"Infection ecology & epidemiology","The East African region has experienced several Rift Valley fever (RVF) outbreaks since the 1930s. The objective of this study was to identify distributions of potential disease vectors in relation to disease epidemics. Understanding disease vector potential distributions is a major concern for disease transmission dynamics.DIVERSE ECOLOGICAL NICHE MODELLING TECHNIQUES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED FOR THIS PURPOSE: we present a maximum entropy (Maxent) approach for estimating distributions of potential RVF vectors in un-sampled areas in East Africa. We modelled the distribution of two species of mosquitoes (Aedes aegypti and Culex pipiens complex) responsible for potential maintenance and amplification of the virus, respectively. Predicted distributions of environmentally suitable areas in East Africa were based on the presence-only occurrence data derived from our entomological study in Ngorongoro District in northern Tanzania.Our model predicted potential suitable areas with high success rates of 90.9% for A. aegypti and 91.6% for C. pipiens complex. Model performance was statistically significantly better than random for both species. Most suitable sites for the two vectors were predicted in central and northwestern Tanzania with previous disease epidemics. Other important risk areas include western Lake Victoria, northern parts of Lake Malawi, and the Rift Valley region of Kenya.Findings from this study show distributions of vectors had biological and epidemiological significance in relation to disease outbreak hotspots, and hence provide guidance for the selection of sampling areas for RVF vectors during inter-epidemic periods."
"Antiviral research","Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is synthesized during the course of infection by RNA viruses as a byproduct of replication and transcription and acts as a potent trigger of the host innate antiviral response. In the cytoplasm of the infected cell, recognition of the presence of viral dsRNA as a signature of ""non-self"" nucleic acid is carried out by RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), a set of dedicated helicases whose activation leads to the production of type I interferon α/β (IFN-α/β). To overcome the innate antiviral response, RNA viruses encode suppressors of IFN-α/β induction, which block RLR recognition of dsRNA by means of different mechanisms that can be categorized into: (i) dsRNA binding and/or shielding (""hide""), (ii) dsRNA termini processing (""mask"") and (iii) direct interaction with components of the RLRs pathway (""hit""). In light of recent functional, biochemical and structural findings, we review the inhibition mechanisms of RLR recognition of dsRNA displayed by a number of highly pathogenic RNA viruses with different disease phenotypes such as haemorrhagic fever (Ebola, Marburg, Lassa, Lujo, Machupo, Junin, Guanarito, Crimean-Congo, Rift Valley fever, dengue), severe respiratory disease (influenza, SARS, Hendra, Hantaan, Sin Nombre, Andes) and encephalitis (Nipah, West Nile).Copyright © 2013.

"Journal of virological methods","In recent years, Madagascar and the Comoros archipelago have been affected by epidemics of Rift Valley fever (RVF), however detection of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) in zebu, sheep and goats during the post epidemic periods was frequently unsuccessful. Thus, a highly sensitive real-time RT-PCR assay was developed for the detection of RVFV at low viral loads. A new RVF SYBR Green RT-PCR targeting the M segment was tested on serum from different RVF seronegative ruminant species collected from May 2010 to August 2011 in Madagascar and the Comoros archipelago and compared with a RVF specific quantitative real time RT-PCR technique, which is considered as the reference technique. The specificity was tested on a wide range of arboviruses or other viruses giving RVF similar clinical signs. A total of 38 out of 2756 serum samples tested positive with the new RT-PCR, whereas the reference technique only detected 5 out of the 2756. The described RT-PCR is an efficient diagnostic tool for the investigation of enzootic circulation of the RVF virus. It allows the detection of low viral RNA loads adapted for the investigations of reservoirs or specific epidemiological situations such as inter-epizootic periods.Copyright © 2013.

"Viruses","Viruses within the Bunyaviridae family are tri-segmented, negative-stranded RNA viruses. The family includes several emerging and re-emerging viruses of humans, animals and plants, such as Rift Valley fever virus, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, La Crosse virus, Schmallenberg virus and tomato spotted wilt virus. Many bunyaviruses are arthropod-borne, so-called arboviruses. Depending on the genus, bunyaviruses encode, in addition to the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and the different structural proteins, one or several non-structural proteins. These non-structural proteins are not always essential for virus growth and replication but can play an important role in viral pathogenesis through their interaction with the host innate immune system. In this review, we will summarize current knowledge and understanding of insect-borne bunyavirus non-structural protein function(s) in vertebrate, plant and arthropod."
"Archives of virology","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a vector-borne virus that causes high neonatal mortality in livestock and deadly haemorrhagic fever in humans. In this paper, we describe the generation of monoclonal antibodies (mabs) against all three structural proteins of RVFV (glycoproteins Gn and Gc and nucleocapsid protein NP). After immunization of BALB/c mice with individual recombinant proteins, a total of 45 clones secreting ELISA-reactive monoclonal antibodies against NP, Gn and Gc epitopes were obtained. Twelve clones were directed to NP, 28 to Gn, and 5 to Gc. Western blot analysis revealed that most of the mabs were reactive to linearized epitopes on recombinant as well as native virus proteins. Six mabs against NP, 21 against Gn and all mabs against Gc also detected conformational epitopes, as shown by indirect immunofluorescence on RVFV-infected cells. All of the mabs were evaluated for their use in a competition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection of a RVFV infection. Several mabs were identified that competed with polyclonal rabbit serum, and one of them - mab Gn123, raised against Gn protein - was selected for a proof-of-principle study with field sera from a recent Rift Valley fever outbreak. The novel Gn-based competition ELISA demonstrated high performance, offering a promising alternative and addition to serological assays based on nucleocapsid protein."
"PloS one","Retrospective studies and surveillance on humans and animals revealed that Rift Valley Fever virus (RVFV) has been circulating on Mayotte for at least several years. A study was conducted in 2011 to estimate the seroprevalence of RVF in humans and in animals and to identify associated risk factors. Using a multistage cluster sampling method, 1420 individuals were enrolled in the human study, including 337 children aged 5 to 14 years. For the animal study, 198 seronegative ruminants from 33 randomly selected sentinel ruminant herds were followed up for more than one year. In both studies, information on environment and risk factors was collected through a standardized questionnaire. The overall weighted seroprevalence of RVFV antibodies in the general population aged ≥5 years was 3.5% (95% CI 2.6-4.8). The overall seroprevalence of RVFV antibodies in the ruminant population was 25.3% (95% CI 19.8-32.2). Age (≥15), gender (men), place of birth on the Comoros, living in Mayotte since less than 5 years, low educational level, farming and living close to a water source were significantly associated with RVFV seropositivity in humans. Major risk factors for RFV infection in animals were the proximity of the farm to a water point, previous two-month rainfall and absence of abortions disposal. Although resulting in few clinical cases in humans and in animals, RVFV has been circulating actively on the island of Mayotte, in a context of regular import of the virus from nearby countries through illegal animal movements, the presence of susceptible animals and a favorable environment for mosquito vectors to maintain virus transmission locally. Humans and animals share the same ways of RVFV transmission, with mosquitoes playing an important role. The studies emphasize the need for a one health approach in which humans and animals within their ecosystems are included."
"Antiviral research","Favipiravir (T-705; 6-fluoro-3-hydroxy-2-pyrazinecarboxamide) is an antiviral drug that selectively inhibits the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of influenza virus. It is phosphoribosylated by cellular enzymes to its active form, favipiravir-ribofuranosyl-5'-triphosphate (RTP). Its antiviral effect is attenuated by the addition of purine nucleic acids, indicating the viral RNA polymerase mistakenly recognizes favipiravir-RTP as a purine nucleotide. Favipiravir is active against a broad range of influenza viruses, including A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H5N1) and the recently emerged A(H7N9) avian virus. It also inhibits influenza strains resistant to current antiviral drugs, and shows a synergistic effect in combination with oseltamivir, thereby expanding influenza treatment options. A Phase III clinical evaluation of favipiravir for influenza therapy has been completed in Japan and two Phase II studies have been completed in the United States. In addition to its anti-influenza activity, favipiravir blocks the replication of many other RNA viruses, including arenaviruses (Junin, Machupo and Pichinde); phleboviruses (Rift Valley fever, sandfly fever and Punta Toro); hantaviruses (Maporal, Dobrava, and Prospect Hill); flaviviruses (yellow fever and West Nile); enteroviruses (polio- and rhinoviruses); an alphavirus, Western equine encephalitis virus; a paramyxovirus, respiratory syncytial virus; and noroviruses. With its unique mechanism of action and broad range of antiviral activity, favipiravir is a promising drug candidate for influenza and many other RNA viral diseases for which there are no approved therapies.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

"PLoS neglected tropical diseases","Viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHF) are acute diseases associated with bleeding, organ failure, and shock. VHF may hardly be distinguished clinically from other diseases in the African hospital, including viral hepatitis. This study was conducted to determine if VHF and viral hepatitis contribute to hospital morbidity in the Central and Northern parts of Ghana.From 2009 to 2011, blood samples of 258 patients with VHF symptoms were collected at 18 hospitals in Ashanti, Brong-Ahafo, Northern, Upper West, and Upper East regions. Patients were tested by PCR for Lassa, Rift Valley, Crimean-Congo, Ebola/Marburg, and yellow fever viruses; hepatitis A (HAV), B (HBV), C (HCV), and E (HEV) viruses; and by ELISA for serological hepatitis markers. None of the patients tested positive for VHF. However, 21 (8.1%) showed anti-HBc IgM plus HBV DNA and/or HBsAg; 37 (14%) showed HBsAg and HBV DNA without anti-HBc IgM; 26 (10%) showed anti-HAV IgM and/or HAV RNA; and 20 (7.8%) were HCV RNA-positive. None was positive for HEV RNA or anti-HEV IgM plus IgG. Viral genotypes were determined as HAV-IB, HBV-A and E, and HCV-1, 2, and 4.VHFs do not cause significant hospital morbidity in the study area. However, the incidence of acute hepatitis A and B, and hepatitis B and C with active virus replication is high. These infections may mimic VHF and need to be considered if VHF is suspected. The data may help decision makers to allocate resources and focus surveillance systems on the diseases of relevance in Ghana."
"PLoS neglected tropical diseases","For enveloped viruses, fusion of the viral envelope with a cellular membrane is critical for a productive infection to occur. This fusion process is mediated by at least three classes of fusion proteins (Class I, II, and III) based on the protein sequence and structure. For Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), the glycoprotein Gc (Class II fusion protein) mediates this fusion event following entry into the endocytic pathway, allowing the viral genome access to the cell cytoplasm. Here, we show that peptides analogous to the RVFV Gc stem region inhibited RVFV infectivity in cell culture by inhibiting the fusion process. Further, we show that infectivity can be inhibited for diverse, unrelated RNA viruses that have Class I (Ebola virus), Class II (Andes virus), or Class III (vesicular stomatitis virus) fusion proteins using this single peptide. Our findings are consistent with an inhibition mechanism similar to that proposed for stem peptide fusion inhibitors of dengue virus in which the RVFV inhibitory peptide first binds to both the virion and cell membranes, allowing it to traffic with the virus into the endocytic pathway. Upon acidification and rearrangement of Gc, the peptide is then able to specifically bind to Gc and prevent fusion of the viral and endocytic membranes, thus inhibiting viral infection. These results could provide novel insights into conserved features among the three classes of viral fusion proteins and offer direction for the future development of broadly active fusion inhibitors."
"Vaccine","This review focuses on the immunization of animals as a means of preventing human diseases (zoonoses). Three frameworks for the use of vaccines in this context are described, and examples are provided of successes and failures. Framework I vaccines are used for protection of humans and economically valuable animals, where neither plays a role in the transmission cycle. The benefit of collaborations between animal health and human health industries and regulators in developing such products is discussed, and one example (West Nile vaccine) of a single product developed for use in animals and humans is described. Framework II vaccines are indicated for domesticated animals as a means of preventing disease in both animals and humans. The agents of concern are transmitted directly or indirectly (e.g. via arthropod vectors) from animals to humans. A number of examples of the use of Framework II vaccines are provided, e.g. against brucellosis, Escherischia coli O157, rabies, Rift Valley fever, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, and Hendra virus. Framework III vaccines are used to immunize wild animals as a means of preventing transmission of disease agents to humans and domesticated animals. Examples are reservoir-targeted, oral bait rabies, Mycobacterium bovis and Lyme disease vaccines. Given the speed and lost cost of veterinary vaccine development, some interventions based on the immunization of animals could lead to rapid and relatively inexpensive advances in public health. Opportunities for vaccine-based approaches to preventing zoonotic and emerging diseases that integrate veterinary and human medicine (the One Health paradigm) are emphasized.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

"Current opinion in ophthalmology","Emergent and resurgent infectious diseases are major causes of systemic morbidity and death that are expanding worldwide mainly because of climate changes and globalization. Among them, specific diseases have been recently associated with ocular involvement. This review presents the ocular manifestations of selected emerging infectious diseases relevant to the ophthalmologist.An array of ocular manifestations, involving mainly the posterior segment, have been recently described in association with specific arthropod vector-borne diseases including rickettsioses, West Nile virus, Rift Valley fever, Dengue fever, and Chikungunya. Influenza A (H1N1) virus has also been recently associated with ocular involvement. On the contrary, with advances in laboratory testing applied to ocular fluids, new infectious agents, mainly viruses, are increasingly being found to be associated with uveitis.Emerging infectious diseases should be considered in the differential diagnosis of retinitis, chorioretinitis, retinal vasculitis, optic neuropathy, or any other ocular inflammatory condition in a patient living in or traveling back from a specific endemic area. On the contrary, ocular fluid sampling and analysis for specific new pathogens can be recommended in selected patients with uveitis of unexplained cause."
"Veterinary research","Rift Valley fever virus (Phlebovirus, Bunyaviridae) is an arbovirus causing intermittent epizootics and sporadic epidemics primarily in East Africa. Infection causes severe and often fatal illness in young sheep, goats and cattle. Domestic animals and humans can be contaminated by close contact with infectious tissues or through mosquito infectious bites. Rift Valley fever virus was historically restricted to sub-Saharan countries. The probability of Rift Valley fever emerging in virgin areas is likely to be increasing. Its geographical range has extended over the past years. As a recent example, autochthonous cases of Rift Valley fever were recorded in 2007--2008 in Mayotte in the Indian Ocean. It has been proposed that a single infected animal that enters a naive country is sufficient to initiate a major outbreak before Rift Valley fever virus would ever be detected. Unless vaccines are available and widely used to limit its expansion, Rift Valley fever will continue to be a critical issue for human and animal health in the region of the Indian Ocean."
"Vaccine","The safety and immunogenicity of an authentic recombinant (ar) of the live, attenuated MP-12 Rift Valley fever (RVF) vaccine virus with a large deletion of the NSm gene in the pre-Gn region of the M RNA segment (arMP-12ΔNSm21/384) was tested in 4-6 month old Bos taurus calves. Phase I of this study evaluated the neutralizing antibody response, measured by 80% plaque reduction neutralization (PRNT80), and clinical response of calves to doses of 1×10(1) through 1×10(7) plaque forming units (PFU) administered subcutaneously (s.c.). Phase II evaluated the clinical and neutralizing antibody response of calves inoculated s.c. or intramuscularly (i.m.) with 1×10(3), 1×10(4) or 1×10(5)PFU of arMP-12ΔNSm21/384. No significant adverse clinical events were observed in the animals in these studies. Of all specimens tested, only one vaccine viral isolate was recovered and that virus retained the introduced deletion. In the Phase I study, there was no statistically significant difference in the PRNT80 response between the dosage groups though the difference in IgG response between the 1×10(1)PFU group and the 1×10(5)PFU group was statistically significant (p<0.05). The PRNT80 response of the respective dosage groups corresponded to dose of vaccine with the 1×10(1)PFU dose group showing the least response. The Phase II study also showed no statistically significant difference in PRNT80 response between the dosage groups though the difference in RVFV-specific IgG values was significantly increased (p<0.001) in animals inoculated i.m. with 1×10(4) or 1×10(5)PFU versus those inoculated s.c. with 1×10(3) or 1×10(5)PFU. Although the study groups were small, these data suggest that 1×10(4) or 1×10(5)PFU of arMP-12ΔNSm21/384 administered i.m. to calves will consistently stimulate a presumably protective PRNT80 response for at least 91 days post inoculation. Further studies of arMP-12ΔNSm21/384 are warranted to explore its suitability as an efficacious livestock vaccine.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
"Veterinary microbiology","The Canary Islands contain the most important dromedary camel (Camelus dromedarius) population in the European Union and are the main export point of dromedaries to continental Europe and Latin America. We investigated the presence of antibodies against relevant disease agents in 100 Canarian camel sera. Selected blood samples of the same animals were also tested by PCR. Sera were tested for antibodies against Bluetongue virus (BTV; 0%), Bovine Viral Diarrhoea virus (BVDV; 0%), Camelpox virus (CPV; 8% by serum neutralization, 16% by ELISA), Peste des Petits Ruminants virus (PPRV, 0%), Rift Valley Fever virus (RVFV; 0%) and West Nile Fever virus (WNV; 3%), the bacterial pathogens Anaplasma sp. (3%), Brucella sp. (1%), Coxiella burnetii (19%), Mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis (MAP; 22%), Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC; 10%) and Rickettsia sp. (83%), and the parasites Toxoplasma gondii (36%) and Neospora caninum (86%). The most remarkable findings were the detection of antibodies against CPV and the high antibody prevalence against C. burnetii, Rickettsia sp., T. gondii and N. caninum. By PCR, we found no C. burnetii, N. caninum and Anaplasma sp. DNA in the tested samples. However, Rickettsia sp. DNA was detected in six antibody positive tested samples. These results should be taken into consideration in order to implement adequate control measures and avoid a potential dissemination of infections to other territories.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

"Protein expression and purification","Schmallenberg virus (SBV) is a novel orthobunyavirus that primarily infects ruminants such as cattle, sheep and goats. The nucleocapsid (N) protein of SBV has been shown to be an ideal target antigen for serological detection. To prepare a monoclonal antibody (mAb) against the N protein, the full-length coding sequence of the SBV N gene was cloned into pET-28a-c(+) and pMAL-c5X vectors to generate two recombinant plasmids, which were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 as histidine (His)-tagged (His-SBV-N) and maltose-binding protein (MBP)-tagged (MBP-SBV-N) fusion proteins, respectively. After affinity purification of His-SBV-N with Ni-NTA agarose and MBP-SBV-N with amylose resin, His-SBV-N was used to immunize BALB/c mice, while MBP-SBV-N was utilized to screen for mAb-secreting hybridomas. Six hybridoma cell lines stably secreting mAbs against N were obtained. Clone 2C8 was selected for further study because of its rapid growth characteristics in vitro and good reactivity with recombinant SBV N proteins in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The epitope recognized by 2C8 is located at amino acids 51-76 of the SBV N protein. Western blot analyses showed that 2C8 reacts with both recombinant SBV N proteins and SBV isolates. It is also cross-reactive with the N proteins of genetically related Shamonda, Douglas and Akabane viruses, but not with the Rift Valley fever virus N protein. The successful preparation of recombinant N proteins and mAbs provides valuable materials that can be used in the serological diagnosis of SBV.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
"Parasite (Paris, France)","Stomoxys flies are mechanical vectors of pathogens present in the blood and skin of their animal hosts, especially livestock, but occasionally humans. In livestock, their direct effects are disturbance, skin lesions, reduction of food intake, stress, blood loss, and a global immunosuppressive effect. They also induce the gathering of animals for mutual protection; meanwhile they favor development of pathogens in the hosts and their transmission. Their indirect effect is the mechanical transmission of pathogens. In case of interrupted feeding, Stomoxys can re-start their blood meal on another host. When injecting saliva prior to blood-sucking, they can inoculate some infected blood remaining on their mouthparts. Beside this immediate transmission, it was observed that Stomoxys may keep some blood in their crop, which offers a friendly environment for pathogens that could be regurgitated during the next blood meal; thus a delayed transmission by Stomoxys seems possible. Such a mechanism has a considerable epidemiological impact since it allows inter-herd transmission of pathogens. Equine infectious anemia, African swine fever, West Nile, and Rift Valley viruses are known to be transmitted by Stomoxys, while others are suspected. Rickettsia (Anaplasma, Coxiella), other bacteria and parasites (Trypanosoma spp., Besnoitia spp.) are also transmitted by Stomoxys. Finally, Stomoxys was also found to act as an intermediate host of the helminth Habronema microstoma and may be involved in the transmission of some Onchocerca and Dirofilaria species. Being cosmopolite, Stomoxys calcitrans might have a worldwide and greater impact than previously thought on animal and human pathogen transmission.© F.

"Journal of virology","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), an ambisense member of the family Bunyaviridae, genus Phlebovirus, is the causative agent of Rift Valley fever, an important zoonotic infection in Africa and the Middle East. Phlebovirus proteins are translated from virally transcribed mRNAs that, like host mRNA, are capped but, unlike host mRNAs, are not polyadenylated. Here, we investigated the role of PABP1 during RVFV infection of HeLa cells. Immunofluorescence studies of infected cells demonstrated a gross relocalization of PABP1 to the nucleus late in infection. Immunofluorescence microscopy studies of nuclear proteins revealed costaining between PABP1 and markers of nuclear speckles. PABP1 relocalization was sharply decreased in cells infected with a strain of RVFV lacking the gene encoding the RVFV nonstructural protein S (NSs). To determine whether PABP1 was required for RVFV infection, we measured the production of nucleocapsid protein (N) in cells transfected with small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting PABP1. We found that the overall percentage of RVFV N-positive cells was not changed by siRNA treatment, indicating that PABP1 was not required for RVFV infection. However, when we analyzed populations of cells producing high versus low levels of PABP1, we found that the percentage of RVFV N-positive cells was decreased in cell populations producing physiologic levels of PABP1 and increased in cells with reduced levels of PABP1. Together, these results suggest that production of the NSs protein during RVFV infection leads to sequestration of PABP1 in the nuclear speckles, creating a state within the cell that favors viral protein production."
"Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE","Many RNA viruses have evolved the ability to inhibit host cell transcription as a means to circumvent cellular defenses. For the study of these viruses, it is therefore important to have a quick and reliable way of measuring transcriptional activity in infected cells. Traditionally, transcription has been measured either by incorporation of radioactive nucleosides such as (3)H-uridine followed by detection via autoradiography or scintillation counting, or incorporation of halogenated uridine analogs such as 5-bromouridine (BrU) followed by detection via immunostaining. The use of radioactive isotopes, however, requires specialized equipment and is not feasible in a number of laboratory settings, while the detection of BrU can be cumbersome and may suffer from low sensitivity. The recently developed click chemistry, which involves a copper-catalyzed triazole formation from an azide and an alkyne, now provides a rapid and highly sensitive alternative to these two methods. Click chemistry is a two step process in which nascent RNA is first labeled by incorporation of the uridine analog 5-ethynyluridine (EU), followed by detection of the label with a fluorescent azide. These azides are available as several different fluorophores, allowing for a wide range of options for visualization. This protocol describes a method to measure transcriptional suppression in cells infected with the Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) strain MP-12 using click chemistry. Concurrently, expression of viral proteins in these cells is determined by classical intracellular immunostaining. Steps 1 through 4 detail a method to visualize transcriptional suppression via fluorescence microscopy, while steps 5 through 8 detail a method to quantify transcriptional suppression via flow cytometry. This protocol is easily adaptable for use with other viruses."
"Vector borne and zoonotic diseases (Larchmont, N.Y.)","Abstract The Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) encodes the structural proteins nucleoprotein (N), aminoterminal glycoprotein (Gn), carboxyterminal glycoprotein (Gc), and L protein, 78-kD, and the nonstructural proteins NSm and NSs. Using the baculovirus system, we expressed the full-length coding sequence of N, NSs, NSm, Gc, and the ectodomain of the coding sequence of the Gn glycoprotein derived from the virulent strain of RVFV ZH548. Western blot analysis using anti-His antibodies and monoclonal antibodies against Gn and N confirmed expression of the recombinant proteins, and in vitro biochemical analysis showed that the two glycoproteins, Gn and Gc, were expressed in glycosylated form. Immunoreactivity profiles of the recombinant proteins in western blot and in indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay against a panel of antisera obtained from vaccinated or wild type (RVFV)-challenged sheep confirmed the results obtained with anti-His antibodies and demonstrated the suitability of the baculo-expressed antigens for diagnostic assays. In addition, these recombinant proteins could be valuable for the development of diagnostic methods that differentiate infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA)."
"Tropical biomedicine","Aedes aegypti (= Stegomyia aegypti) mosquito is a world vector of important arboviral diseases like dengue and Rift Valley fever. Despite its wide distribution in the western and southern regions of Saudi Arabia, where dengue outbreaks have occurred, its ecology is largely unknown. In this study we report on the main life table developmental attributes of a laboratory colony of Ae. aegypti reared from field-collected larvae from Madinah Province, west of Saudi Arabia. Females were maintained on daily blood meal and sugar. The female fecundity was ~62 eggs/female at an overall rate of 72% hatchability. The mean time needed for eggs to hatch into larvae was 4.5 d. The mean pupation time (P50) was 11.53 days (d). The proportion of immature survivorships were 0.69 for 1(st) larva to pupa (P/I), 0.98 for pupa to adult (A/P) and an overall 0.67 for 1(st) larva to adult (A/I). Males emerged faster than females with mean emergence time (E50) of 12.83 and 15.31 d, respectively. The average developmental velocity (V) showed that males (V= 0.081) developed faster than females (V= 0.068). The male/female sex ratio at adult emergence was 0.48, and insignificantly different from the 1:1 ratio. The adult mean life expectancy at emergence (eo) was 17.14 d for females compared to 9.59 d for males. The net reproductive rate (Ro) was 101.04 and the intrinsic rate of increase (rm) was 0.15 with a mean generation time (G) of 30.7 d. The instantaneous mean of birth (B) and death rate (D) were 0.30 and 0.15, respectively, with rm/B of 0.529 and B/D of 2.281. Compared to other Ae. aegypti strains from different geographic and ecological settings, the Saudi strain had a relatively low colonization potential. This is the first report on life table characteristics for Ae. aegypti from the Arabian Peninsula, and provides base-line information for wider studies on its natural populations. This is particularly important for understanding its population dynamics in relation to dengue transmission and control under regional conditions."
"PLoS neglected tropical diseases","In recent years, evidence of Rift Valley fever (RVF) transmission during inter-epidemic periods in parts of Africa has increasingly been reported. The inter-epidemic transmissions generally pass undetected where there is no surveillance in the livestock or human populations. We studied the presence of and the determinants for inter-epidemic RVF transmission in an area experiencing annual flooding in southern Tanzania.A cross-sectional sero-survey was conducted in randomly selected cattle, sheep and goats in the Kilombero river valley from May to August 2011, approximately four years after the 2006/07 RVF outbreak in Tanzania. The exposure status to RVF virus (RVFV) was determined using two commercial ELISA kits, detecting IgM and IgG antibodies in serum. Information about determinants was obtained through structured interviews with herd owners.An overall seroprevalence of 11.3% (n = 1680) was recorded; 5.5% in animals born after the 2006/07 RVF outbreak and 22.7% in animals present during the outbreak. There was a linear increase in prevalence in the post-epidemic annual cohorts. Nine inhibition-ELISA positive samples were also positive for RVFV IgM antibodies indicating a recent infection. The spatial distribution of seroprevalence exhibited a few hotspots. The sex difference in seroprevalence in animals born after the previous epidemic was not significant (6.1% vs. 4.6% for females and males respectively, p = 0.158) whereas it was significant in animals present during the outbreak (26.0% vs. 7.8% for females and males respectively, p<0.001). Animals living >15 km from the flood plain were more likely to have antibodies than those living <5 km (OR 1.92; 95% CI 1.04-3.56). Species, breed, herd composition, grazing practices and altitude were not associated with seropositivity.These findings indicate post-epidemic transmission of RVFV in the study area. The linear increase in seroprevalence in the post-epidemic annual cohorts implies a constant exposure and presence of active foci transmission preceding the survey."
"Journal of the American Mosquito Control Association","Aedes japonicus japonicus was introduced into the northeastern USA in 1998 and has since spread to more than 25 states. Because this species has been shown to be a competent laboratory vector of several viruses, readily feeds on large mammals, and has become a pest in several areas, there is concern that it might serve as a vector of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) should that virus be introduced into North America. Infection with RVFV causes mortality in > 90% of young domestic ungulates (e.g., calves, kids, and lambs), as well as causing a febrile illness and occasional deaths in humans. Therefore, we evaluated Ae. j. japonicus captured in North Carolina and in Maryland for their ability to serve as potential vectors for RVFV. After feeding on infected adult hamsters, these mosquitoes were tested for infection, dissemination, and the ability to transmit RVFV after incubation at 26 degrees C for 7-28 days. Both the Maryland and North Carolina populations of Ae. j. japonicus were highly efficient laboratory vectors of RVFV, with infection rates > 90% and dissemination rates > 84% for those mosquitoes that fed on hamsters with viremias > or = 10(8.5) plaque-forming units/ml. Thus, Ae. j. japonicus should be targeted for immediate control should RVFV be introduced into an area where this mosquito is now present."
"The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene","Rift Valley Fever (RVF) is a significant threat to human health because it can progress to retinitis, encephalitis, and hemorrhagic fever. The timing of onset of Rift Valley Fever virus (RVFV) retinitis suggests an autoimmune origin. To determine whether RVFV retinitis is associated with increased levels of IgG against retinal tissue, we measured and compared levels of IgG against healthy human eye tissue by immunohistochemical analysis. We found that serum samples from RVFV-exposed Kenyans with retinitis (n = 8) were slightly more likely to have antibodies against retinal tissue than control populations, but the correlation was not statistically significant. Further investigation into the possible immune pathogenesis of RVFV retinitis could lead to improved therapies to prevent or treat this severe complication."
"Veterinary research","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a zoonotic vector-borne infection and causes a potentially severe disease. Many mammals are susceptible to infection including important livestock species. Although currently confined to Africa and the near-East, this disease causes concern in countries in temperate climates where both hosts and potential vectors are present, such as the Netherlands. Currently, an assessment of the probability of an outbreak occurring in this country is missing. To evaluate the transmission potential of RVFV, a mathematical model was developed and used to determine the initial growth and the Floquet ratio, which are indicators of the probability of an outbreak and of persistence in a periodic changing environment caused by seasonality. We show that several areas of the Netherlands have a high transmission potential and risk of persistence of the infection. Counter-intuitively, these are the sparsely populated livestock areas, due to the high vector-host ratios in these areas. Culex pipiens s.l. is found to be the main driver of the spread and persistence, because it is by far the most abundant mosquito. Our investigation underscores the importance to determine the vector competence of this mosquito species for RVFV and its host preference."
"PLoS neglected tropical diseases","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a mosquito-borne pathogen causing an important disease in ruminants often transmitted to humans after epizootic outbreaks in African and Arabian countries. To help combat the spread of the disease, prophylactic measures need to be developed and/or improved.In this work, we evaluated the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of recombinant plasmid DNA and modified vaccinia virus Ankara (rMVA) vectored vaccines against Rift Valley fever in mice. These recombinant vaccines encoded either of two components of the Rift Valley fever virus: the viral glycoproteins (Gn/Gc) or the nucleoprotein (N). Following lethal challenge with live RVFV, mice immunized with a single dose of the rMVA-Gn/Gc vaccine showed no viraemia or clinical manifestation of disease, but mounted RVFV neutralizing antibodies and glycoprotein specific CD8+ T-cell responses. Neither DNA-Gn/Gc alone nor a heterologous prime-boost immunization schedule (DNA-Gn/Gc followed by rMVAGn/Gc) was better than the single rMVA-Gn/Gc immunization schedule with regards to protective efficacy. However, the rMVA-Gn/Gc vaccine failed to protect IFNAR(-/-) mice upon lethal RVFV challenge suggesting a role for innate responses in protection against RVFV. Despite induction of high titer antibodies against the RVFV nucleoprotein, the rMVA-N vaccine, whether in homologous or heterologous prime-boost schedules with the corresponding recombinant DNA vaccine, only conferred partial protection to RVFV challenge.Given the excellent safety profile of rMVA based vaccines in humans and animals, our data supports further development of rMVA-Gn/Gc as a vaccine strategy that can be used for the prevention of Rift Valley fever in both humans and livestock."
"PLoS neglected tropical diseases","Rift Valley Fever Virus (RVFV) is a zoonotic virus that is not only an emerging pathogen but is also considered a biodefense pathogen due to the threat it may cause to public health and national security. The current state of diagnosis has led to misdiagnosis early on in infection. Here we describe the use of a novel sample preparation technology, NanoTrap particles, to enhance the detection of RVFV. Previous studies demonstrated that NanoTrap particles lead to both 100 percent capture of protein analytes as well as an improvement of more than 100-fold in sensitivity compared to existing methods. Here we extend these findings by demonstrating the capture and enrichment of viruses.Screening of NanoTrap particles indicated that one particle, NT53, was the most efficient at RVFV capture as demonstrated by both qRT-PCR and plaque assays. Importantly, NT53 capture of RVFV resulted in greater than 100-fold enrichment from low viral titers when other diagnostics assays may produce false negatives. NT53 was also capable of capturing and enhancing RVFV detection from serum samples. RVFV that was inactivated through either detergent or heat treatment was still found bound to NT53, indicating the ability to use NanoTrap particles for viral capture prior to transport to a BSL-2 environment. Furthermore, both NP-40-lysed virus and purified RVFV RNA were bound by NT53. Importantly, NT53 protected viral RNA from RNase A degradation, which was not observed with other commercially available beads. Incubation of RVFV samples with NT53 also resulted in increased viral stability as demonstrated through preservation of infectivity at elevated temperatures. Finally, NanoTrap particles were capable of capturing VEEV and HIV, demonstrating the broad applicability of NanoTrap particles for viral diagnostics.This study demonstrates NanoTrap particles are capable of capturing, enriching, and protecting RVFV virions. Furthermore, the use of NanoTrap particles can be extended to a variety of viruses, including VEEV and HIV."
"Journal of virological methods","Outbreaks of Rift Valley fever in Kenya, Madagascar, Mauritania, and South Africa had devastating effects on livestock and human health. In addition, this disease is a food security issue for endemic countries. There is growing concern for the potential introduction of RVF into non-endemic countries. A number of single-gene target amplification assays have been developed for the rapid detection of RVF viral RNA. This paper describes the development of an improved amplification assay that includes two confirmatory target RNA segments (L and M) and a third target gene, NSs, which is deleted in the Clone 13 commercial vaccine and other candidate vaccines. The assay also contains an exogenous RNA control added during the PCR setup for detection of amplification inhibitors. The assay was evaluated initially with samples from experimentally infected animals, after which clinical veterinary and human samples from endemic countries were tested for further evaluation. The assay has a sensitivity range of 66.7-100% and a specificity of 92.0-100% depending on the comparison. The assay has an overall sensitivity of 92.5%, specificity of 95% and a positive predictive value of 98.7%. The single-tube assay provides confirmation of the presence of RVFV RNA for improved confidence in diagnostic results and a ""differentiate infected from vaccinated animals"" (DIVA) - compatible marker for RVFV NSs - deleted vaccines, which is useful for RVF endemic countries, but especially important in non-endemic countries.Published by Elsevier B.V."
"PloS one","Since the first isolation of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) in the 1930s, there have been multiple epizootics and epidemics in animals and humans in sub-Saharan Africa. Prospective climate-based models have recently been developed that flag areas at risk of RVFV transmission in endemic regions based on key environmental indicators that precede Rift Valley fever (RVF) epizootics and epidemics. Although the timing and locations of human case data from the 2006-2007 RVF outbreak in Kenya have been compared to risk zones flagged by the model, seroprevalence of RVF antibodies in wildlife has not yet been analyzed in light of temporal and spatial predictions of RVF activity. Primarily wild ungulate serum samples from periods before, during, and after the 2006-2007 RVF epizootic were analyzed for the presence of RVFV IgM and/or IgG antibody. Results show an increase in RVF seropositivity from samples collected in 2007 (31.8%), compared to antibody prevalence observed from 2000-2006 (3.3%). After the epizootic, average RVF seropositivity diminished to 5% in samples collected from 2008-2009. Overlaying maps of modeled RVF risk assessments with sampling locations indicated positive RVF serology in several species of wild ungulate in or near areas flagged as being at risk for RVF. Our results establish the need to continue and expand sero-surveillance of wildlife species Kenya and elsewhere in the Horn of Africa to further calibrate and improve the RVF risk model, and better understand the dynamics of RVFV transmission."
"Journal of the American Mosquito Control Association","The Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a threat that must not be neglected, as the consequences of RVFV are dramatic, both for human and animal health. This virus is a zoonotic virus that already has demonstrated a real capacity for re-emerging after long periods of silence, as observed in Barkedji (Senegal, West Africa) in 2002. In this article we present the 2nd emergence in Barkedji after the 1st manifestation in 1993, and for the 1st time the circulation of RVFV during 2 consecutive years among mosquito populations in Senegal. As part of the entomological surveillance program undertaken since 1990 to detect circulation of the RVFV in Barkedji, 108,336 mosquitoes belonging to 34 species and 5 genera were collected in 2002-2003. Aedes vexans and Culex poicilipes, previously known to be vectors of RVFV in Senegal, comprised 88.7% of the total collection. In 2002, Ae. vexans was the most abundant mosquito, followed by Cx. poicilipes; the opposite situation was observed in 2003. In 2002, 29 and 10 RVFV isolates were obtained from Cx. poicilipes (minimum infection rate [MIR] = 0.13%) and Ae. vexans (MIR = 0.02%) pools, respectively and the MIR for the 2 species were significantly different (chi2 = 34.65; df = 1, P < 0.001). In 2003, 7 RVFV strains were isolated from Cx. poicilipes (3, MIR = 0.03), Mansonia africana (2, MIR = 0.08), Ae. fowleri (1), and Ma. uniformis (1, MIR = 0.05). The 3 latter species were found to be associated with RVFV for the 1st time in Senegal. A significant decrease in MIR was observed from 2002 to 2003 (chi2 6.28; df = 1, P = 0.01) for Cx. poicilipes, the only species involved in the transmission during the 2 sampling years."
"Genes & development","Bunyaviruses are an emerging group of medically important viruses, many of which are transmitted from insects to mammals. To identify host factors that impact infection, we performed a genome-wide RNAi screen in Drosophila and identified 131 genes that impacted infection of the mosquito-transmitted bunyavirus Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV). Dcp2, the catalytic component of the mRNA decapping machinery, and two decapping activators, DDX6 and LSM7, were antiviral against disparate bunyaviruses in both insect cells and adult flies. Bunyaviruses 5' cap their mRNAs by ""cap-snatching"" the 5' ends of poorly defined host mRNAs. We found that RVFV cap-snatches the 5' ends of Dcp2 targeted mRNAs, including cell cycle-related genes. Loss of Dcp2 allows increased viral transcription without impacting viral mRNA stability, while ectopic expression of Dcp2 impedes viral transcription. Furthermore, arresting cells in late S/early G2 led to increased Dcp2 mRNA targets and increased RVFV replication. Therefore, RVFV competes for the Dcp2-accessible mRNA pool, which is dynamically regulated and can present a bottleneck for viral replication."
"Journal of medical entomology","There were epidemic-epizootics of Rift Valley Fever (RVF) affecting humans and cattle in Madagascar in the district of Anjozorobe in 2008. Little is known about the role of Malagasy mosquitoes in the circulation of RVF virus. Therefore, we investigated the species diversity, dynamics and biology of potential RVF virus vectors in the rainforest, rainforest edge (village of Anorana), and savanna biotope (village of Antanifotsy) of this district between November 2008 and July 2010. We captured 56,605 adults of 35 different species. Anopheles squamosus (Theobald), Anopheles coustani (Laveran), Culex antennatus (Becker), Culex pipiens (L.), and Culex univittatus (Theobald) were the most abundant during the rainy season with Cx. pipiens the most abundant species in the rainforest (47%), and An. squamosus the most abundant species in the rainforest edge and in the savanna biotope (56%, 60%, respectively). Only Cx. univittatus was abundant in the dry season. The parous rate was > 60% throughout the rainy season for An. squamosus and it was > 50% from the middle to the end of the rainy season for Cx. pipiens. Two additional species have been found only at larval stage. Cattle were the most attractive bait for all species, followed by sheep and poultry. Human was the least attractive for all species. Most of the 163 bloodmeals tested were taken from cattle. Three were from poultry, one was from dog and one was a mixed bloodmeal taken from sheep and cattle. These results on vectorial capacity parameters may allow considering the involvement of mosquito transmission of the virus in the district of Anjozorobe during the recent epidemic-epizootic."

"Journal of arthropod-borne diseases","West Nile virus (WNV) and Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) are mosquito-borne viral diseases. The objective of this study was to investigate the RVFV and WNV infections as serologically in different mammalian species (cattle, horse, goat, sheep and water buffalo) in the northern Turkey.Blood samples randomly collected from 70 each cattle, horse, sheep, goat and water buffalo were analyzed for the presence of antibodies to RVFV and WNV using an competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (C-ELISA) in northern Turkey.None of the animals were positive for antibodies to RVFV. In contrast, WNV antibodies were found in two of 350 samples (0.57%).This may suggest that the RVFV disease is not present in northern Turkey.This is the first serological study on RVFV in Turkey."
"PLoS neglected tropical diseases","Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a severe mosquito-borne disease affecting humans and domestic ruminants. Mosquito saliva contains compounds that counteract the hemostatic, inflammatory, and immune responses of the host. Modulation of these defensive responses may facilitate virus infection. Indeed, Aedes mosquito saliva played a crucial role in the vector's capacity to effectively transfer arboviruses such as the Cache Valley and West Nile viruses. The role of mosquito saliva in the transmission of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) has not been investigated.Using a murine model, we explored the potential for mosquitoes to impact the course of RVF disease by determining whether differences in pathogenesis occurred in the presence or absence of mosquito saliva and salivary gland extract.C57BL/6NRJ male mice were infected with the ZH548 strain of RVFV via intraperitoneal or intradermal route, or via bites from RVFV-exposed mosquitoes. The virus titers in mosquitoes and mouse organs were determined by plaque assays.After intraperitoneal injection, RVFV infection primarily resulted in liver damage. In contrast, RVFV infection via intradermal injection caused both liver and neurological symptoms and this route best mimicked the natural infection by mosquitoes. Co-injections of RVFV with salivary gland extract or saliva via intradermal route increased the mortality rates of mice, as well as the virus titers measured in several organs and in the blood. Furthermore, the blood cell counts of infected mice were altered compared to those of uninfected mice.Different routes of infection determine the pattern in which the virus spreads and the organs it targets. Aedes saliva significantly increases the pathogenicity of RVFV."
"Journal of wildlife diseases","Emerging infectious disease events are frequently caused by arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) that are maintained in a zoonotic cycle between arthropod vectors and vertebrate wildlife species, with spillover to humans in areas where human and wildlife populations interface. The greater Congo basin region, including Uganda, has historically been a hot spot for emergence of known and novel arboviruses. Surveillance of arthropod vectors is a critical activity in monitoring and predicting outbreaks of arboviral disease, and identification of blood meals in engorged arthropods collected during surveillance efforts provides insight into the ecology of arboviruses and their vectors. As part of an ongoing arbovirus surveillance project we analyzed blood meals from engorged mosquitoes collected at five sites in western Uganda November 2008-June 2010. We extracted DNA from the dissected and triturated abdomens of engorged mosquito specimens. Mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I gene sequence was amplified by PCR and sequenced to identify the source of the mosquito host blood. Blood meals were analyzed from 533 engorged mosquito specimens; 440 of these blood meals were successfully identified from 33 mosquito species. Species identifications were made for 285 of the 440 identified specimens with the remainder identified to genus, family, or order. When combined with published arbovirus isolation and serologic survey data, our results suggest possible vector-reservoir relationships for several arboviruses, including Rift Valley fever virus and West Nile virus."
"Current opinion in virology","With a few exceptions, vaccines for viruses that cause hemorrhagic fever remain unavailable or lack well-documented efficacy. In the past decade this has not been due to a lack of the ability to develop vaccine platforms against highly pathogenic viruses, but rather the lack of will/interest to invest in platforms that have the potential to become successful vaccines. The two exceptions to this are vaccines against Dengue virus (DENV) and Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), which recently have seen significant progress in putting forward new and improved vaccines, respectively. Experimental vaccines for filoviruses and Lassa virus (LASV) do exist but are hindered by a lack of financial interest and only partially or ill-defined correlates/mechanisms of protection that could be assessed in clinical trials.Published by Elsevier B.V."

Indeed, the struggle against these emerging infectious diseases requires an early detection of the cases, thus a surveillance system capable of detecting them as early as possible, thanks to a real international network of information, warning and prevention."

"PloS one","The mosquito, Culex tritaeniorhynchus Giles is a prevalent and confirmed Rift Valley Fever virus (RVFV) vector. This vector, in association with Aedimorphus arabiensis (Patton), was responsible for causing the outbreak of 2000 in Jazan Province, Saudi Arabia.Larval occurrence records and a total of 19 bioclimatic and three topographic layers imported from Worldclim Database were used to predict the larval suitable breeding habitats for this vector in Jazan Province using ArcGIS ver.10 and MaxEnt modeling program. Also, a supervised land cover classification from SPOT5 imagery was developed to assess the land cover distribution within the suitable predicted habitats. Eleven bioclimatic and slope attributes were found to be the significant predictors for this larval suitable breeding habitat. Precipitation and temperature were strong predictors of mosquito distribution. Among six land cover classes, the linear regression model (LM) indicated wet muddy substrate is significantly associated with high-very high suitable predicted habitats (R(2) = 73.7%, P<0.05). Also, LM indicated that total dissolved salts (TDS) was a significant contributor (R(2) = 23.9%, P<0.01) in determining mosquito larval abundance.This model is a first step in understanding the spatial distribution of Cx. tritaeniorhynchus and consequently the risk of RVFV in Saudi Arabia and to assist in planning effective mosquito surveillance and control programs by public health personnel and researchers."
"Emerging infectious diseases","A Rift Valley fever (RVF) epidemic affecting animals on domestic livestock farms was reported in South Africa during January-August 2010. The first cases occurred after heavy rainfall, and the virus subsequently spread countrywide. To determine the possible effect of environmental conditions and vaccination on RVF virus transmissibility, we estimated the effective reproduction number (Re) for the virus over the course of the epidemic by extending the Wallinga and Teunis algorithm with spatial information. Re reached its highest value in mid-February and fell below unity around mid-March, when vaccination coverage was 7.5%-45.7% and vector-suitable environmental conditions were maintained. The epidemic fade-out likely resulted first from the immunization of animals following natural infection or vaccination. The decline in vector-suitable environmental conditions from April onwards and further vaccination helped maintain Re below unity. Increased availability of vaccine use data would enable evaluation of the effect of RVF vaccination campaigns."

"Journal of virology","We show that interferon-induced transmembrane protein 1 (IFITM-1), IFITM-2, and IFITM-3 exhibit a broad spectrum of antiviral activity against several members of the Bunyaviridae family, including Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), La Crosse virus, Andes virus, and Hantaan virus, all of which can cause severe disease in humans and animals. We found that RVFV was restricted by IFITM-2 and -3 but not by IFITM-1, whereas the remaining viruses were equally restricted by all IFITMs. Indeed, at low doses of alpha interferon (IFN-α), IFITM-2 and -3 mediated more than half of the antiviral activity of IFN-α against RVFV. IFITM-2 and -3 restricted RVFV infection mostly by preventing virus membrane fusion with endosomes, while they had no effect on virion attachment to cells, endocytosis, or viral replication kinetics. We found that large fractions of IFITM-2 and IFITM-3 occupy vesicular compartments that are distinct from the vesicles coated by IFITM-1. In addition, although overexpression of all IFITMs expanded vesicular and acidified compartments within cells, there were marked phenotypic differences among the vesicular compartments occupied by IFITMs. Collectively, our data provide new insights into the possible mechanisms by which the IFITM family members restrict distinct viruses."
"Journal of the South African Veterinary Association","In July 2006, a case of two out of three lambs born to one ewe in a flock of 45 had signs that, in retrospect, were possibly consistent with Schmallenberg virus infection. This occurred in the Onderstepoort area (Gauteng Province) but a definitive diagnosis was not made. Then, in May 2008, a farmer in the Delmas area (Mpumalanga Province) reported that deformed lambs had been born to several ewes in the flock. Six of the approximately 50 mated ewes gave birth to lambs showing varying degrees of arthrogryposis, torticollis, kyphosis, mandibular brachygnathia and hydrocephalus. Of these, only two were born alive but they died within a few hours. Blood was collected from the ewes with deformed lambs, a random sample of ewes that had given birth to normal lambs and a lamb that was normal but had a twin that was deformed. The samples were tested for Wesselsbron and Akabane antibodies using a complement fixation test and a haemagglutination/haemagglutination inhibition test that were available at that time. Bluetongue virus antibodies were also tested for using a commercial Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test. All samples showed negative results for all diseases tested. At the time Rift Valley fever virus had not been diagnosed in that region for many years and so it was not included in the testing. It is unlikely that this was the cause as no liver pathology was detected on postmortem examination of the lambs and no adult ewes had died. The farmer reported that another farm just a few kilometres away experienced the same deformities in some of their lambs but this farm was not investigated. During investigation it was thought that the cause was possibly a new strain of Akabane virus, although there was no way to confirm it. However, with the recent discovery of the Schmallenberg virus, it is possible that this virus has been present in South Africa for at least the last four years without being identified."
"The Onderstepoort journal of veterinary research","Several outbreaks of Rift Valley fever (RVF) have been documented in South Africa since it first occurred in the country in 1950. However, there is no comprehensive account of the timing, location and extent of all known outbreaks. As part of a study investigating the epidemiology of RVF in South Africa, a full history of outbreaks was compiled using references to the disease in South Africa from scientific literature, annual reports, disease reports and animal disease databases. The geographic location and temporal occurrence of each outbreak were recorded as accurately as allowed by the available records. The result was a better and more complete picture than has hitherto been available of the spatial and temporal distribution of RVF in South Africa for the period between 1950 and 2011. Several smaller outbreaks which had not been described previously in literature were documented. Extensive outbreaks occurred in the central interior of the country (Free State, Eastern Cape and Northern Cape provinces), interspersed with smaller outbreaks or long intervening periods of absence, whilst smaller outbreaks occurred in the eastern part of the country (KwaZulu-Natal, Mpumalanga and Gauteng)."
"PLoS neglected tropical diseases","Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a viral zoonosis that primarily affects animals resulting in considerable economic losses due to death and abortions among infected livestock. RVF also affects humans with clinical symptoms ranging from an influenza-like illness to a hemorrhagic fever. Over the past years, RVF virus (RVFV) has caused severe outbreaks in livestock and humans throughout Africa and regions of the world previously regarded as free of the virus. This situation prompts the need to evaluate the diagnostic capacity and performance of laboratories worldwide. Diagnostic methods for RVFV detection include virus isolation, antigen and antibody detection methods, and nucleic acid amplification techniques. Molecular methods such as reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and other newly developed techniques allow for a rapid and accurate detection of RVFV. This study aims to assess the efficiency and accurateness of RVFV molecular diagnostic methods used by expert laboratories worldwide. Thirty expert laboratories from 16 countries received a panel of 14 samples which included RVFV preparations representing several genetic lineages, a specificity control and negative controls. In this study we present the results of the first international external quality assessment (EQA) for the molecular diagnosis of RVF. Optimal results were reported by 64% of the analyses, 21% of the analyses achieved acceptable results and 15% of the results revealed that there is need for improvement. Evenly good performances were achieved by specific protocols which can therefore be recommended as an accurate molecular protocol for the diagnosis of RVF. Other protocols showed uneven performances revealing the need for improved optimization and standardization of these protocols."
"Journal of virology","The L polymerase of bunyaviruses replicates and transcribes the viral genome. While replication products are faithful copies of the uncapped genomic RNA, transcription products contain capped 5' extensions which had been cleaved from host cell mRNAs. For La Crosse virus (LACV; genus Orthobunyavirus), the nuclease responsible for host cell mRNA cleavage is located at the N terminus of the L protein, with an active site of five conserved amino acids (H34, D52, D79, D92, and K94) surrounding two Mn(2+) ions (J. Reguera, F. Weber, and S. Cusack, PLoS Pathog. 6:e1001101, 2010). Here, we present reverse genetics systems and L mutants enabling us to study bunyaviral genome replication in the absence of transcription. Transcription was evaluated with an enhanced minigenome system consisting of the viral polymerase L, nucleocapsid protein N, a negative-sense minigenome, and--to alleviate antiviral host responses--a dominant-negative mutant (PKRΔE7) of the antiviral kinase protein kinase R (PKR). The transcriptional activity was strongly reduced by mutation of any of the five key amino acids, and the H34K, D79A, D92A, and K94A LACV L mutants were almost entirely silent in transcription. The replication activity of the L mutants was measured by packaging of progeny minigenomes into virus-like particles (VLPs). All mutant L proteins except K94A retained full replication activity. To test the broader applicability of our results, we introduced the homolog of mutation D79A (D111A) into the L sequence of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV; genus Phlebovirus). As for LACV D79A, the RVFV D111A was incapable of transcription but fully active in replication. Thus, we generated mutants of LACV and RVFV L polymerases that are specifically deficient in transcription. Genome replication by bunyavirus polymerases can now be studied in the absence of transcription using convenient reverse genetics systems."
"Journal of the Egyptian Society of Parasitology","The Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a neglected, emerging, mosquito-borne disease with severe negative impact on human and animal health and economy. RVF is caused by RVF virus of the family of Bunyaviridae, genus Phlebovirus. RVF is an acute, febrile disease affecting humans and a wide range of animals. The virus is trans-mitted through the bites from mosquitoes and exposure to viremic blood, body fluids, or contact with tissues of infected animals or by inhaling natural virus aerosols, also possibly by consumption of infected unpasteurized milk. The RVF-virus replicate at the site introduction and in local lymphatic followed by viremia and spread to other organs as the liver and central nervous system, causing the hepatic necrosis and eosinophilia cytoplasmic degeneration. The main signs and symptoms are fever, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, photophobia, bradycardia, conjunctivitis and flushing face. Main complications include jaundice, hemorrhagic, meningoencephalitis and retinal lesions. Generally speaking, in the 21st Century, the vector-borne infectious diseases, was accepted as the disaster issues with the considerable significant morbidity and mortality. These facts should be considered by the public health, veterinary and agricultural authorities"
"Journal of virological methods","Yellow fever, a mosquito-borne disease, is an important viral hemorrhagic fever in Africa and South America where it is endemic. Detection of yellow fever virus (YFV) in Africa remains a challenge due to a lack of highly specific tests. The aim of this study was to develop and optimize a rapid detection reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) for YFV. The RT-LAMP was done isothermally at 62 °C using a real-time turbidimeter that allowed detection within 1h. Specificity of the RT-LAMP was determined using RNA from flaviviruses and other related viruses where only YFV RNA was detected: West Nile virus, dengue viruses, Japanese encephalitis virus, Rift Valley fever virus, and chikungunya virus. In addition, equal sensitivity was also observed when the RT-LAMP and the real-time RT-PCR were compared using YFV-spiked human serum samples with a detection limit of 0.29 PFU/ml. Two Kenyan YFV wild strains showed an equal detection limit as the vaccine strain 17D in this study. The RT-LAMP reduced the time of reaction from 3h to 1h and increased sensitivity tenfold compared to RT-PCR. Therefore, this test offers a simple, rapid and reliable diagnostic tool for yellow fever when there are outbreaks of acute hemorrhagic fever in Kenya and other African countries.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

"PloS one","The mandatory bovine abortion notification system in France aims to detect as soon as possible any resurgence of bovine brucellosis. However, under-reporting seems to be a major limitation of this system. We used a unilist capture-recapture approach to assess the sensitivity, i.e. the proportion of farmers who reported at least one abortion among those who detected such events, and representativeness of the system during 2006-2011. We implemented a zero-inflated Poisson model to estimate the proportion of farmers who detected at least one abortion, and among them, the proportion of farmers not reporting. We also applied a hurdle model to evaluate the effect of factors influencing the notification process. We found that the overall surveillance sensitivity was about 34%, and was higher in beef than dairy cattle farms. The observed increase in the proportion of notifying farmers from 2007 to 2009 resulted from an increase in the surveillance sensitivity in 2007/2008 and an increase in the proportion of farmers who detected at least one abortion in 2008/2009. These patterns suggest a raise in farmers' awareness in 2007/2008 when the Bluetongue Virus (BTV) was detected in France, followed by an increase in the number of abortions in 2008/2009 as BTV spread across the country. Our study indicated a lack of sensitivity of the mandatory bovine abortion notification system, raising concerns about the ability to detect brucellosis outbreaks early. With the increasing need to survey the zoonotic Rift Valley Fever and Q fever diseases that may also cause bovine abortions, our approach is of primary interest for animal health stakeholders to develop information programs to increase abortion notifications. Our framework combining hurdle and ZIP models may also be applied to estimate the completeness of other clinical surveillance systems."
"Developments in biologicals","Disease outbreaks caused by arthropod-borne animal viruses (arboviruses) resulting in significant livestock and economic losses world-wide appear to be increasing. Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus is an important arbovirus that causes lethal disease in cattle, camels, sheep and goats in Sub-Saharan Africa. There is concern that this virus could spread because of global warming, increased animal trade or through bioterrorism. This paper discusses the current and developing approaches to diagnosis of RVF. Diagnostic assays are available for RVF, but availability can be limited and there is a need for global harmonization. Continued improvement of standard serological and viral genome amplification approaches, including new embedded/syndromic testing, biosensor, emerging virus detection and characterization technologies is needed.

"Developments in biologicals","Vaccination continues to be the most effective way to control Rift Valley fever (RVF), a zoonotic insect-borne viral disease of livestock. The irregular, cyclical and persistent nature of RVF in its occurrence in enzootic situations suggests that the vaccination strategy to be considered for these regions should be different from what is envisaged for free from risk regions. Currently available RVF vaccines have been extensively used for the control of the disease. However, these vaccines have shortcomings that have encouraged many research groups to develop new vaccine candidates that would address a large number of the current challenges, and be suitable for use both in disease-free regions and in different contingency and emergency preparedness strategies. The characteristics of different RVF vaccines and vaccination strategies are discussed in this report.

"Vector borne and zoonotic diseases (Larchmont, N.Y.)","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a zoonotic bunyavirus that causes abortions in domesticated ruminants. Sheep breeds exotic to endemic areas are reportedly the most susceptible to RVFV infection. Within the scope of a risk assessment program of The Netherlands, we investigated the susceptibility of a native breed of gestating sheep to RVFV infection. Ewes were infected experimentally during the first, second, or third trimester of gestation. Mortality was high among ewes that developed viremia. Four of 11 inoculated ewes, however, did not develop detectable viremia nor clinical signs and did not seroconvert for immunoglobulin G (IgG) or IgM antibodies. Surprisingly, these ewes were found to contain viral RNA in maternal and fetal organs, and the presence of live virus in fetal organs was demonstrated by virus isolation. We demonstrate that RVFV can be transmitted vertically in the absence of detectable maternal viremia."
"Journal of infection and public health","Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus has expanded its geographical range, reaching Asia in 2000. This work investigated RVF seroprevalence among children born after the 2000-2001 outbreak in Saudi Arabia and compared it with the seroprevalence of adolescents born before the outbreak.In a seroepidemiological study in southwestern Saudi Arabia (Jazan, Aseer, and Al-Qunfuda), a random sample of 389 children and adolescents was investigated. Data were collected regarding the subjects' sociodemographic status, housing conditions, and animal contact. Blood samples were collected and tested for RVF-specific IgG and IgM.None of the study samples were found to be seropositive for anti-RVF virus IgM. None of the study subjects aged 1-8 years (born after the outbreak) were positive for RVF-specific IgG. In contrast, 14 subjects (4.8%) aged 9-19 years (born before the outbreak) were positive for RVF-specific IgG. Among adolescents in our study, 4.9% were positive for anti-RVF IgG. This study showed that among adolescents, a history of contact with aborted animals (aOR=13.361, 95% CI=5.091-35.072) and transporting aborted animals (aOR=18.861, 95% CI=11.125-31.622) were significant risk factors.Despite the low virus activity recently reported among animals, neither clinically apparent RVF infections nor outbreaks among humans have been documented, indicating that the control measures taken by the Ministry of Agriculture and Ministry of Health are effective.Copyright © 2013 King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences.

"PloS one","Rift Valley fever is a vector-borne zoonotic disease which causes high morbidity and mortality in livestock. In the event Rift Valley fever virus is introduced to the United States or other non-endemic areas, understanding the potential patterns of spread and the areas at risk based on disease vectors and hosts will be vital for developing mitigation strategies. Presented here is a general network-based mathematical model of Rift Valley fever. Given a lack of empirical data on disease vector species and their vector competence, this discrete time epidemic model uses stochastic parameters following several PERT distributions to model the dynamic interactions between hosts and likely North American mosquito vectors in dispersed geographic areas. Spatial effects and climate factors are also addressed in the model. The model is applied to a large directed asymmetric network of 3,621 nodes based on actual farms to examine a hypothetical introduction to some counties of Texas, an important ranching area in the United States of America. The nodes of the networks represent livestock farms, livestock markets, and feedlots, and the links represent cattle movements and mosquito diffusion between different nodes. Cattle and mosquito (Aedes and Culex) populations are treated with different contact networks to assess virus propagation. Rift Valley fever virus spread is assessed under various initial infection conditions (infected mosquito eggs, adults or cattle). A surprising trend is fewer initial infectious organisms result in a longer delay before a larger and more prolonged outbreak. The delay is likely caused by a lack of herd immunity while the infection expands geographically before becoming an epidemic involving many dispersed farms and animals almost simultaneously. Cattle movement between farms is a large driver of virus expansion, thus quarantines can be efficient mitigation strategy to prevent further geographic spread."
"Research in veterinary science","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is an emerging zoonotic pathogen that causes high morbidity and mortality in humans and livestock. In this paper, we describe the cloning, expression and purification of RVFV glycoprotein Gn and its application as a diagnostic antigen in an indirect ELISA for the specific detection of RVF IgG antibodies in sheep and goats. The performance of this Gn based ELISA is validated using a panel of almost 2000 field samples from sheep and goats from Mozambique, Senegal, Uganda and Yemen. All serum samples were also tested by virus neutralization test (VNT), the gold standard method for RVFV serological testing. Compared to the VNT results the Gn based ELISA proved to have an excellent sensitivity (94.56%) and specificity (95.57%). Apart from establishing this new diagnostic assay, these results also demonstrate a close correlation between the presence of RVFV Gn and neutralizing antibodies.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

"PLoS neglected tropical diseases","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV; genus Phlebovirus, family Bunyaviridae) is a mosquito-borne zoonotic pathogen which can cause hemorrhagic fever, neurological disorders or blindness in humans, and a high rate of abortion in ruminants. MP-12 strain, a live-attenuated candidate vaccine, is attenuated in the M- and L-segments, but the S-segment retains the virulent phenotype. MP-12 was manufactured as an Investigational New Drug vaccine by using MRC-5 cells and encodes a functional NSs gene, the major virulence factor of RVFV which 1) induces a shutoff of the host transcription, 2) inhibits interferon (IFN)-β promoter activation, and 3) promotes the degradation of dsRNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR). MP-12 lacks a marker for differentiation of infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA). Although MP-12 lacking NSs works for DIVA, it does not replicate efficiently in type-I IFN-competent MRC-5 cells, while the use of type-I IFN-incompetent cells may negatively affect its genetic stability. To generate modified MP-12 vaccine candidates encoding a DIVA marker, while still replicating efficiently in MRC-5 cells, we generated recombinant MP-12 encoding Punta Toro virus Adames strain NSs (rMP12-PTNSs) or Sandfly fever Sicilian virus NSs (rMP12-SFSNSs) in place of MP-12 NSs. We have demonstrated that those recombinant MP-12 viruses inhibit IFN-β mRNA synthesis, yet do not promote the degradation of PKR. The rMP12-PTNSs, but not rMP12-SFSNSs, replicated more efficiently than recombinant MP-12 lacking NSs in MRC-5 cells. Mice vaccinated with rMP12-PTNSs or rMP12-SFSNSs induced neutralizing antibodies at a level equivalent to those vaccinated with MP-12, and were efficiently protected from wild-type RVFV challenge. The rMP12-PTNSs and rMP12-SFSNSs did not induce antibodies cross-reactive to anti-RVFV NSs antibody and are therefore applicable to DIVA. Thus, rMP12-PTNSs is highly efficacious, replicates efficiently in MRC-5 cells, and encodes a DIVA marker, all of which are important for vaccine development for Rift Valley fever."
"PLoS pathogens","LJ001 is a lipophilic thiazolidine derivative that inhibits the entry of numerous enveloped viruses at non-cytotoxic concentrations (IC50 ≤ 0.5 µM), and was posited to exploit the physiological difference between static viral membranes and biogenic cellular membranes. We now report on the molecular mechanism that results in LJ001's specific inhibition of virus-cell fusion. The antiviral activity of LJ001 was light-dependent, required the presence of molecular oxygen, and was reversed by singlet oxygen ((1)O2) quenchers, qualifying LJ001 as a type II photosensitizer. Unsaturated phospholipids were the main target modified by LJ001-generated (1)O2. Hydroxylated fatty acid species were detected in model and viral membranes treated with LJ001, but not its inactive molecular analog, LJ025. (1)O2-mediated allylic hydroxylation of unsaturated phospholipids leads to a trans-isomerization of the double bond and concurrent formation of a hydroxyl group in the middle of the hydrophobic lipid bilayer. LJ001-induced (1)O2-mediated lipid oxidation negatively impacts on the biophysical properties of viral membranes (membrane curvature and fluidity) critical for productive virus-cell membrane fusion. LJ001 did not mediate any apparent damage on biogenic cellular membranes, likely due to multiple endogenous cytoprotection mechanisms against phospholipid hydroperoxides. Based on our understanding of LJ001's mechanism of action, we designed a new class of membrane-intercalating photosensitizers to overcome LJ001's limitations for use as an in vivo antiviral agent. Structure activity relationship (SAR) studies led to a novel class of compounds (oxazolidine-2,4-dithiones) with (1) 100-fold improved in vitro potency (IC50<10 nM), (2) red-shifted absorption spectra (for better tissue penetration), (3) increased quantum yield (efficiency of (1)O2 generation), and (4) 10-100-fold improved bioavailability. Candidate compounds in our new series moderately but significantly (p≤0.01) delayed the time to death in a murine lethal challenge model of Rift Valley Fever Virus (RVFV). The viral membrane may be a viable target for broad-spectrum antivirals that target virus-cell fusion."
"Epidemiology and infection","SUMMARY Sindbis virus (SINV), the prototype positive-sense RNA alphavirus, causes febrile arthritis and is present throughout Afro-Eurasia. Little is known of the epidemiology of Sindbis fever due to insufficient surveillance in most endemic countries. The epidemiological features of Sindbis fever in humans in South Africa are described here based on a retrospective study of suspected arbovirus cases submitted for laboratory investigation from 2006 to 2010. Cases were detected annually mostly during the late summer/early autumn months and an increase in cases was noted for 2010, coinciding with an outbreak of Rift Valley fever. Cases were reported most often from the central plateau of South Africa and involved mostly males. No severe or fatal cases were reported and cases were associated with febrile arthralgia as commonly reported for SINV infection. Further surveillance is required to reveal the true extent of the morbidity of Sindbis fever in South Africa."
"Clinical microbiology and infection : the official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases","For a few years, a series of traditionally tropical mosquito-borne diseases, such as chikungunya fever and dengue, have posed challenges to national public health authorities in the European region. Other diseases have re-emerged, e.g. malaria in Greece, or spread to other countries, e.g. West Nile fever. These diseases are reportable within the European Union (EU), and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control collects information in various ways to provide EU member states with topical assessments of disease threats, risks and trends for prompt and appropriate public health action. Using disease-specific expert networks, the European Surveillance System (TESSy) collects standardized comparable information on all statutory communicable diseases in a database. In addition, the event-based surveillance aims to detect potential public health threats early, and to allow timely response and support to blood deferral decisions for pathogens that can be transmitted through blood donation. Laboratory capacity for early detection is implemented through external quality assessments. Other activities include the development of guidelines for the surveillance of mosquito vectors, and the production of regularly updated maps on the currently known occurrence of mosquito vector species.© 2013 The Authors Clinical Microbiology and Infection © 2013 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases."
"Veterinary microbiology","Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a mosquito-borne viral disease that may produce a considerable impact on the economy in affected countries. In the last decades, the geographic distribution of RVF virus has increased including most of the countries in Africa, Arabia Saudi and Yemen. This situation has raised the concerns regarding its potential introduction in the European Union (EU) countries where the high number of susceptible species and competent vectors may contribute to the spread of the disease and challenge its rapid control. Thus, the identification of the areas and time periods with highest suitability for RVF outbreak occurrence would be useful for improving the early detection and rapid response of the disease into free countries. The objective of this study was to identify suitable areas for the occurrence of RVF outbreaks in Spain using a multiple criteria decision making model based on weighted linear combination of factors in geographical information systems (GIS). To the best of the author's knowledge this is the first comprehensive GIS-based framework that provides risk maps for RVF suitability in an EU country. Spanish zones with the highest suitability for RVF were concentrated in the regions of Extremadura, south-western Castile and Leon, eastern Galicia, Asturias, Cantabria, Basque Country, northern-central and southern region of Andalusia and in the Balearic Islands. October and May were the most suitable months for RVF outbreak occurrence. Methods and results presented here may be useful to target risk-based surveillance strategies and to more cost-effectively control potential RVFV incursions into Spain.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

"PLoS neglected tropical diseases","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is an important mosquito-borne veterinary and human pathogen that can cause severe disease including acute-onset hepatitis, delayed-onset encephalitis, retinitis and blindness, or a hemorrhagic syndrome. Currently, no licensed vaccine or therapeutics exist to treat this potentially deadly disease. Detailed studies describing the pathogenesis of RVFV following aerosol exposure have not been completed and candidate therapeutics have not been evaluated following an aerosol exposure. These studies are important because while mosquito transmission is the primary means for human infection, it can also be transmitted by aerosol or through mucosal contact. Therefore, we directly compared the pathogenesis of RVFV following aerosol exposure to a subcutaneous (SC) exposure in the murine model by analyzing survival, clinical observations, blood chemistry, hematology, immunohistochemistry, and virus titration of tissues. Additionally, we evaluated the effectiveness of the nucleoside analog ribavirin administered prophylactically to treat mice exposed by aerosol and SC. The route of exposure did not significantly affect the survival, chemistry or hematology results of the mice. Acute hepatitis occurred despite the route of exposure. However, the development of neuropathology occurred much earlier and was more severe in mice exposed by aerosol compared to SC exposed mice. Mice treated with ribavirin and exposed SC were partially protected, whereas treated mice exposed by aerosol were not protected. Early and aggressive viral invasion of brain tissues following aerosol exposure likely played an important role in ribavirin's failure to prevent mortality among these animals. Our results highlight the need for more candidate antivirals to treat RVFV infection, especially in the case of a potential aerosol exposure. Additionally, our study provides an account of the key pathogenetic differences in RVF disease following two potential exposure routes and provides important insights into the development and evaluation of potential vaccines and therapeutics to treat RVFV infection."
"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","Bunyamwera virus (BUNV), which belongs to the genus Orthobunyavirus, is the prototypical virus of the Bunyaviridae family. Similar to other negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses, bunyaviruses possess a nucleocapsid protein (NP) to facilitate genomic RNA encapsidation and virus replication. The structures of two NPs of members of different genera within the Bunyaviridae family have been reported. However, their structures, RNA-binding features, and functions beyond RNA binding significantly differ from one another. Here, we report the crystal structure of the BUNV NP-RNA complex. The polypeptide of the BUNV NP was found to possess a distinct fold among viral NPs. An N-terminal arm and a C-terminal tail were found to interact with neighboring NP protomers to form a tetrameric ring-shaped organization. Each protomer bound a 10-nt RNA molecule, which was acquired from the expression host, in the positively charged crevice between the N and C lobes. Inhomogeneous oligomerization was observed for the recombinant BUNV NP-RNA complex, which was similar to the Rift Valley fever virus NP-RNA complex. This result suggested that the flexibility of one NP protomer with adjacent protomers underlies the BUNV ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP) formation. Electron microscopy revealed that the monomer-sized NP-RNA complex was the building block of the natural BUNV RNP. Combined with previous results indicating that mutagenesis of the interprotomer or protein-RNA interface affects BUNV replication, our structure provides a great potential for understanding the mechanism underlying negative-sense single-stranded RNA RNP formation and enables the development of antiviral therapies targeting BUNV RNP formation."
"Transboundary and emerging diseases","Rift Valley fever (RVF) is an emerging zoonotic mosquito-borne infectious disease that has been identified as a risk for spread to other continents and can cause mass livestock mortality. In equatorial Africa, outbreaks of RVF are associated with high rainfall, when vector populations are at their highest. It is, however, unclear how RVF virus persists during the inter-epidemic periods and between seasons. Understanding inter-epidemic persistence as well as the role of vectors and hosts is paramount to creating effective management programmes for RVF control. We created a mathematical model for the spread of RVF and used the model to explore different scenarios of persistence including vertical transmission and alternate wildlife hosts, with a case study on buffalo in Kruger National Park, South Africa. Our results suggest that RVF persistence is a delicate balance between numerous species of susceptible hosts, mosquito species, vertical transmission and environmental stochasticity. Further investigations should not focus on a single species, but should instead consider a myriad of susceptible host species when seeking to understand disease dynamics.© 2013 Blackwell Verlag GmbH."
"Journal of virological methods","Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus (CCHFV) activity has been detected in Kordufan region of the Sudan in 2008 with high case-fatality rates in villages and rural hospitals in the region. Therefore, in the present study, a reverse transcription (RT) loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay was developed and compared to nested RT-PCR for rapid detection of CCHFV targeting the small (S) RNA segment. A set of RT-LAMP primers, designed from a highly conserved region of the S segment of the viral genome, was employed to identify all the Sudanese CCHFV strains. The sensitivity studies indicated that the RT-LAMP detected 10fg of CCHFV RNA as determined by naked eye turbidity read out, which is more likely the way it would be read in a resource-poor setting. This level of sensitivity is good enough to detect most acute cases. Using agarose gel electrophoresis, the RT-LAMP assay detected as little as 0.1fg of viral RNA (equivalent to 50 viral particle). There was 100% agreement between results of the RT-LAMP and the nested PCR when testing 10-fold serial dilution of CCHFV RNA. The specificity studies indicated that there was no cross-reactivity with other related hemorrhagic fever viruses circulating in Sudan including, Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), Dengue fever virus, and yellow fever virus. The RT-LAMP was performed under isothermal conditions at 63°C and no special apparatus was needed, which rendered the assay more economical and practical than real-time PCR in such developing countries, like Sudan. In addition, the RT-LAMP provides a valuable tool for rapid detection and differentiation of CCHFV during an outbreak of the disease in remote areas and in rural hospitals with resource-poor settings.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

"Journal of virology","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) causes outbreaks of severe disease in people and livestock throughout Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. Human RVFV infections generally manifest as a self-limiting febrile illness, but in some individuals, the disease can progress to a fatal encephalitis or hemorrhagic syndrome. Little is known about the host characteristics that predispose development of more severe disease. Early in infection, interferon-mediated antiviral responses are critical for controlling RVFV replication, but the roles of downstream adaptive immune responses in determining clinical outcome have not been examined. Here, using a C57BL/6 mouse disease model, we evaluated the roles of B cells and T cells in RVFV pathogenesis. Given the profound inhibition of the innate response by the viral NSs protein and rapid course of wild-type infection, we utilized an attenuated RVFV lacking NSs to examine host responses following primary infection. Experiments utilizing B-cell-deficient mice or targeted T cell depletions of wild-type mice demonstrated that B cells and CD4(+) T cells, but not CD8(+) T cells, were critical for mediating viral clearance, even in the presence of a functional innate response. One-third of CD4-depleted mice developed severe neurologic disease following infection, in contrast to virus-infected mock-depleted mice that showed no clinical signs. CD4(+) T cells were required for robust IgG and neutralizing antibody responses that correlated with RVFV clearance from peripheral tissues. Furthermore, CD4-depleted mice demonstrated significantly stronger proinflammatory responses relative to controls, suggesting CD4(+) T cells regulate immune responses to RVFV infection. Together, these results indicate CD4(+) T cells are critical determinants of RVFV pathogenesis and play an important role in preventing onset of neurologic disease."
"Analytical biochemistry","To fully understand the interactions of a pathogen with its host, it is necessary to analyze the RNA transcripts of both the host and pathogen throughout the course of an infection. Although this can be accomplished relatively easily on the host side, the analysis of pathogen transcripts is complicated by the overwhelming amount of host RNA isolated from an infected sample. Even with the read depth provided by second-generation sequencing, it is extremely difficult to get enough pathogen reads for an effective gene-level analysis. In this study, we describe a novel capture-based technique and device that considerably enriches for pathogen transcripts from infected samples. This versatile method can, in principle, enrich for any pathogen in any infected sample. To test the technique's efficacy, we performed time course tissue culture infections using Rift Valley fever virus and Francisella tularensis. At each time point, RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was performed and the results of the treated samples were compared with untreated controls. The capture of pathogen transcripts, in all cases, led to more than an order of magnitude enrichment of pathogen reads, greatly increasing the number of genes hit, the coverage of those genes, and the depth at which each transcript was sequenced.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

"PloS one","There is no licensed human vaccine currently available for Rift Valley Fever Virus (RVFV), a Category A high priority pathogen and a serious zoonotic threat. While neutralizing antibodies targeting the viral glycoproteins are protective, they appear late in the course of infection, and may not be induced in time to prevent a natural or bioterrorism-induced outbreak. Here we examined the immunogenicity of RVFV nucleocapsid (N) protein as a CD8(+) T cell antigen with the potential for inducing rapid protection after vaccination. HLA-A*0201 (A2)-restricted epitopic determinants were identified with N-specific CD8(+) T cells from eight healthy donors that were primed with dendritic cells transduced to express N, and subsequently expanded in vitro by weekly re-stimulations with monocytes pulsed with 59 15mer overlapping peptides (OLPs) across N. Two immunodominant epitopes, VT9 (VLSEWLPVT, N(121-129)) and IL9 (ILDAHSLYL, N165-173), were defined. VT9- and IL9-specific CD8(+) T cells identified by tetramer staining were cytotoxic and polyfunctional, characteristics deemed important for viral control in vivo. These peptides induced specific CD8(+) T cell responses in A2-transgenic mice, and more importantly, potent N-specific CD8(+) T cell reactivities, including VT9- and IL9-specific ones, were mounted by mice after a booster vaccination with the live attenuated RVF MP-12. Our data suggest that the RVFV N protein is a potent human T cell immunogen capable of eliciting broad, immunodominant CD8(+) T cell responses that are potentially protective. Understanding the immune responses to the nucleocapsid is central to the design of an effective RVFV vaccine irrespective of whether this viral protein is effective as a stand-alone immunogen or only in combination with other RVFV antigens."
"Antiviral research","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) causes severe disease in humans and livestock. There are currently no approved antivirals or vaccines for the treatment or prevention of RVF disease in humans. A major virulence factor of RVFV is the NSs protein, which inhibits host transcription including the interferon (IFN)-β gene and promotes the degradation of dsRNA-dependent protein kinase, PKR. We analyzed the efficacy of the live-attenuated MP-12 vaccine strain and MP-12 variants that lack the NSs protein as post-exposure vaccinations. Although parental MP-12 failed to elicit a protective effect in mice challenged with wild-type (wt) RVFV by the intranasal route, significant protection was demonstrated by vaccination with MP-12 strains lacking NSs when they were administered at 20-30 min post-exposure. Viremia and virus replication in liver, spleen and brain were also inhibited by post-exposure vaccination with MP-12 lacking NSs. The protective effect was mostly lost when vaccination was delayed 6 or 24 h after intranasal RVFV challenge. When mice were challenged subcutaneously, efficacy of MP-12 lacking NSs was diminished, most likely due to more rapid dissemination of wt RVFV. Our findings suggest that post-exposure vaccination with MP-12 lacking NSs may be developed as a novel post-exposure treatment to prevent RVF.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"Revue scientifique et technique (International Office of Epizootics)","The authors characterised sources of early warning messages about occurrences of Rift Valley fever (RVF) and examined the response measures that were used by the Department of Veterinary Services (DVS) to manage the 2006-2007 RVF outbreaks in Kenya. The study was conducted between November 2009 and March 2010 and it included national, provincial and district veterinary officers who were involved in the management of the outbreak. Structured questionnaires were used to collect the data. Although the majority of the respondents reported having limited capacity to implement response measures, they perceived that the measures implemented were effective. Vaccination, movement control and market closures were the main response measures implemented, particularly in districts that had cases in both livestock and humans. Vaccination, however, was implemented too late and the coverage achieved was too low to be effective. The authors suggest ways to improve the capacity of the DVS to respond to similar outbreaks in the future."
"Clinical microbiology and infection : the official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases","Rift Valley fever (RVF), a vector-borne zoonotic disease caused by a phlebovirus (family Bunyaviridae), is considered to be one of the most important viral zoonoses in Africa. It is also a potential bioterrorism agent. Transmitted by mosquitoes or by direct contact with viraemic products, RVF affects both livestock and humans, causing abortion storms in pregnant ruminants and sudden death in newborns. The disease provokes flu syndrome in most human cases, but also severe encephalitic or haemorrhagic forms and death. There is neither a treatment nor a vaccine for humans. The disease, historically confined to the African continent, recently spread to the Arabian Peninsula and Indian Ocean. Animal movements, legal or illegal, strongly contribute to viral spread, threatening the Mediterranean basin and Europe, where competent vectors are present. Given the unpredictability of virus introduction and uncertainties about RVF epidemiology, there is an urgent need to fill the scientific gaps by developing large regional research programmes, to build predictive models, and to implement early warning systems and surveillance designs adapted to northern African and European countries.© 2013 The Author Clinical Microbiology and Infection © 2013 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases."
"The Journal of general virology","Rift Valley fever is a mosquito-borne zoonotic disease endemic to sub-Saharan Africa. Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV; genus Phlebovirus, family Bunyaviridae) causes high rates of abortion and fetal malformation in pregnant ruminants, and haemorrhagic fever, neurological disorders or blindness in humans. The MP-12 strain is a highly efficacious and safe live-attenuated vaccine candidate for both humans and ruminants. However, MP-12 lacks a marker to differentiate infected from vaccinated animals. In this study, we originally aimed to characterize the efficacy of a recombinant RVFV MP-12 strain encoding Toscana virus (TOSV) NSs gene in place of MP-12 NSs (rMP12-TOSNSs). TOSV NSs promotes the degradation of dsRNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) and inhibits interferon-β gene up-regulation without suppressing host general transcription. Unexpectedly, rMP12-TOSNSs increased death in vaccinated outbred mice and inbred BALB/c or C57BL/6 mice. Immunohistochemistry showed diffusely positive viral antigens in the thalamus, hypothalamus and brainstem, including the medulla. No viral antigens were detected in spleen or liver, which is similar to the antigen distribution of moribund mice infected with MP-12. These results suggest that rMP12-TOSNSs retains neuroinvasiveness in mice. Our findings demonstrate that rMP12-TOSNSs causes neuroinvasion without any hepatic disease and will be useful for studying the neuroinvasion mechanism of RVFV and TOSV."
"Antiviral research","Five different viral diseases of livestock, lumpy skin disease (LSD), sheep pox (SPP), goat pox (GTP), Rift Valley fever (RVF) and peste des petits ruminants (PPR), circulate in the same regions of Africa, imposing a major burden on economic activity and public health. While commercial vaccines against these viruses are available, the cost of implementing regular vaccination regimens against multiple diseases is prohibitive for most African farmers. A single, affordable multivalent vaccine that simultaneously protects against all 5 diseases would therefore be of significant benefit to the livestock sector in Africa. It could also serve as a platform for the development of new vaccines of significance to other developing countries around the world. In this paper, we present an overview of the economic importance of livestock in Africa, the pathogens responsible for RVF, PPR, SPP, GTP and LSD and the vaccination strategies currently used to combat them. We then review experience with the development of attenuated capripoxviruses as vaccines against LSD, SPP and GTP and of recombinant capripoxvirus-vectored vaccines against RVF and PPR. We conclude the article by presenting the rationale for a single, multivalent capripoxvirus-vectored vaccine that would protect against all 5 diseases of livestock, and describe the approach being taken by a consortium of Canadian and South African researchers to develop such a vaccine.Crown Copyright © 2013.

"BMC infectious diseases","Investigations were conducted by the authors to explore an outbreak of viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF) reported in 2010 from Al-Mukalla city, the capital of Hadramout in Yemen.From 15-17 June 2010, the outbreak investigation period, specimens were obtained within 7 days after onset of illness of 18 acutely ill patients hospitalized with VHF and 15 household asymptomatic contacts of 6 acute cases. Additionally, 189 stored sera taken from acutely ill patients with suspected VHF hospitalized in the preceding 12 months were obtained from the Ministry of Health of Yemen. Thus, a total of 222 human specimens were collected; 207 specimens from acute cases and 15 specimens from contacts. All samples were tested with RT-PCR for dengue (DENV), Alkhumra (ALKV), Rift Valley Fever (RVFV), Yellow Fever (YFV), and Chikungunya (CHIKV) viruses. Samples were also tested for DENV IgM, IgG, and NS1-antigen. Medical records of patients were reviewed and demographic, clinical, and laboratory data was collected.Of 207 patients tested, 181 (87.4%) patients were confirmed to have acute dengue with positive dengue NS1-antigen (97 patients, 46.9%) and/or IgM (163 patients, 78.7%). Of the 181 patients with confirmed dengue, 100 (55.2%) patients were IgG-positive. DENV RNA was detected in 2 (1%) patients with acute symptoms; both samples were molecularly typed as DENV type 3. No other VHF viruses were detected. For the 15 contacts tested, RT-PCR tests for the five viruses were negative, one contact was dengue IgM positive, and another one was dengue IgG positive. Of the 181 confirmed dengue patients, 120 (66.3%) patients were males and the median age was 24 years. The most common manifestations included fever (100%), headache (94.5%), backache (93.4%), malaise (88.4%), arthralgia (85.1%), myalgia (82.3%), bone pain (77.9%), and leukopenia (76.2%). Two (1.1%) patients died.DENV-3 was confirmed to be the cause of an outbreak of VHF in Al-Mukalla. It is important to use both IgM and NS1-antigen tests to confirm acute dengue particularly under the adverse field conditions, where proper storage and transportation of specimens are missing, which substantially reduce the sensitivity of the RT-PCR for detecting DENV RNA."
"Zoonoses and public health","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is an arbovirus that causes significant morbidity and mortality in both humans and livestock. With increased world travel and the threat of bioterrorism, there is a real risk of RVFV spreading to naïve geographical areas (Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg., 73, 1979, 618; MMWR Morb. Mortal. Wkly Rep., 49, 2000, 905). The introduction of RVFV would cause critical public health, agricultural and economic damage. Despite the clear need for an efficacious vaccine, there are no United States (US) Food and Drug Administration or US Department of Agriculture approved vaccines against RVFV. To address this need, a virus-like particle (VLP)-based vaccine candidate was developed. First, a non-replicating chimeric RVF VLP vaccine candidate was generated that protected mice and rats against a lethal RVFV challenge. This was followed by the development and optimization of conditions for production of RVF VLPs in insect and mammalian cells. Immunological studies demonstrated that VLP-based vaccine candidates elicit both humoral and cellular immune responses. Subsequent challenge studies using a lethal wild-type RVFV strain under high-containment conditions showed that RVF VLP vaccine candidates can completely protect mice and rats.© 2012 Blackwell Verlag GmbH."
"Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene","This paper provides an overview of the methods in which geographic information systems (GIS) and remote sensing (RS) technology have been used to visualise and analyse data related to vectorborne diseases (VBD) in West Africa and to discuss the potential for these approaches to be routinely included in future studies of VBDs. GIS/RS studies of diseases that are associated with a specific geographic landscape were reviewed, including malaria, human African trypanosomiasis, leishmaniasis, lymphatic filariasis, Loa loa filariasis, onchocerciasis, Rift Valley fever, dengue, yellow fever, borreliosis, rickettsioses, Buruli ulcer and Q fever. RS data and powerful spatial modelling methods improve our understanding of how environmental factors affect the vectors and transmission of VBDs. There is great potential for the use of GIS/RS technologies in the surveillance, prevention and control of vectorborne and other infectious diseases in West Africa."
"Vector borne and zoonotic diseases (Larchmont, N.Y.)","Wesselsbron disease is a neglected, mosquito-borne zoonotic infection reported from Africa. The disease primarily affects sheep and other ruminants with incidental spillover to humans. As for other arboviral diseases in Africa, little or no active surveillance is conducted, and the public and veterinary health burden of this disease remains unclear. We report on the clinical histories of 2 human cases of Wesselsbron disease that were laboratory confirmed during the 2010-2011 Rift Valley fever outbreak investigation in South Africa. This report describes the first confirmed human cases of Wesselsbron disease since 1996. Molecular sequencing and analysis of the partial NS5 gene of the Wesselsbron genome was used to identify 2 circulating clades of the virus in southern Africa. Clade I included isolates collected from South Africa and Zimbabwe, whereas clade II only included isolates from the KwaZulu Natal Province of South Africa."
"PLoS neglected tropical diseases","Rift Valley fever (RVF) is endemic in most parts of Africa and has also been reported to occur in the Arabian Peninsula. It is responsible for significant morbidity and mortality, particularly in livestock, but also in humans. During the last two decades several outbreaks of RVF have been reported in countries in Southern Africa. In contrast to other countries, no clinical disease has been reported in Mozambique during this period. In a serological study conducted in 2007 in five districts of Zambézia Province, Mozambique, of a total of 654 small ruminants sampled (277 sheep and 377 goats), 35.8% of sheep sera and 21.2% of goat sera were positive for RVF virus (RVFV) antibodies in a virus neutralization test (VN) and in an IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In 2010, a cross-sectional survey was conducted in 313 sheep and 449 goats in two districts of the same province. This study revealed an overall seropositivity rate of 9.2% in sheep and 11.6% in goat and an increased likelihood of being seropositive in older animals (OR = 7.3; p<0.001) using an IgG ELISA. 29 out of 240 animals assessed for RVF specific IgM by ELISA were positive, suggesting recent exposure to RVFV. However, a longitudinal study carried out between September 2010 and April 2011 in a cohort of 125 of these animals (74 sheep and 51 goats) failed to demonstrate seroconversion. The results of the study indicate that RVFV circulates sub-clinically in domestic small ruminants in Zambézia Province."
"Mathematical biosciences","A wide range of infectious diseases are both vertically and horizontally transmitted. Such diseases are spatially transmitted via multiple species in heterogeneous environments, typically described by complex meta-population models. The reproduction number, R0, is a critical metric predicting whether the disease can invade the meta-population system. This paper presents the reproduction number for a generic disease vertically and horizontally transmitted among multiple species in heterogeneous networks, where nodes are locations, and links reflect outgoing or incoming movement flows. The metapopulation model for vertically and horizontally transmitted diseases is gradually formulated from two species, two-node network models. We derived an explicit expression of R0, which is the spectral radius of a matrix reduced in size with respect to the original next generation matrix. The reproduction number is shown to be a function of vertical and horizontal transmission parameters, and the lower bound is the reproduction number for horizontal transmission. As an application, the reproduction number and its bounds for the Rift Valley fever zoonosis, where livestock, mosquitoes, and humans are the involved species are derived. By computing the reproduction number for different scenarios through numerical simulations, we found the reproduction number is affected by livestock movement rates only when parameters are heterogeneous across nodes. To summarize, our study contributes the reproduction number for vertically and horizontally transmitted diseases in heterogeneous networks. This explicit expression is easily adaptable to specific infectious diseases, affording insights into disease evolution.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
"International journal of health geographics","Dynamics of most of vector-borne diseases are strongly linked to global and local environmental changes. Landscape changes are indicators of human activities or natural processes that are likely to modify the ecology of the diseases. Here, a landscape approach developed at a local scale is proposed for extracting mosquito favourable biotopes, and for testing ecological parameters when identifying risk areas of Rift Valley fever (RVF) transmission. The study was carried out around Barkedji village, Ferlo region, Senegal.In order to test whether pond characteristics may influence the density and the dispersal behaviour of RVF vectors, and thus the spatial variation in RVFV transmission, we used a very high spatial resolution remote sensing image (2.4 m resolution) provided by the Quickbird sensor to produce a detailed land-cover map of the study area. Based on knowledge of vector and disease ecology, seven landscape attributes were defined at the pond level and computed from the land-cover map. Then, the relationships between landscape attributes and RVF serologic incidence rates in small ruminants were analyzed through a beta-binomial regression. Finally, the best statistical model according to the Akaike Information Criterion corrected for small samples (AICC), was used to map areas at risk for RVF.Among the derived landscape variables, the vegetation density index (VDI) computed within a 500 m buffer around ponds was positively correlated with serologic incidence (p<0.001), suggesting that the risk of RVF transmission was higher in the vicinity of ponds surrounded by a dense vegetation cover. The final risk map of RVF transmission displays a heterogeneous spatial distribution, corroborating previous findings from the same area.Our results highlight the potential of very high spatial resolution remote sensing data for identifying environmental risk factors and mapping RVF risk areas at a local scale."
"Epidemiology and infection","In southern African transfrontier conservation areas (TFCAs), people, livestock and wildlife share space and resources in semi-arid landscapes. One consequence of the coexistence of wild and domestic herbivores is the risk of pathogen transmission. This risk threatens local livelihoods relying on animal production, public health in the case of zoonoses, national economies in the context of transboundary animal diseases, and the success of integrated conservation and development initiatives. The level of interaction between sympatric wild and domestic hosts, defining different wildlife/livestock interfaces, characterizes opportunities of pathogen transmission between host populations. Exploring the relationship between infection burden and different types of wildlife/domestic interfaces is therefore necessary to manage the sanitary risk in animal populations through control options adapted to these multi-host systems. Here, we assessed the infection burdens of sympatric domestic cattle (Bos taurus/Bos indicus) and African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) at an unfenced interface and compared the infection burdens of cattle populations at different wildlife/livestock interfaces in the Great Limpopo TFCA. Patterns of infection in ungulate populations varied between wild and domestic hosts and between cattle populations at different wildlife/livestock interfaces. Foot-and-mouth disease, Rift Valley fever and theileriosis infections were detected in buffalo and cattle at unfenced interfaces; bovine tuberculosis was only present in buffalo; and brucellosis and lumpy skin disease only in cattle. At unfenced interfaces, cattle populations presented significantly higher Theileria parva and brucellosis prevalence. We hypothesize that cattle populations at wildlife/livestock interfaces face an increased risk of infection compared to those isolated from wildlife, and that the type of interface could influence the diversity and quantity of pathogens shared. Additional host behavioural and molecular epidemiological studies need to be conducted to support this hypothesis. If it is confirmed, the management of wildlife/livestock interfaces will need to be considered through the prism of livestock and public health."
"Epidemics","In 2009, a novel Bunyavirus, called severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) was identified in the vicinity of Huaiyangshan, China. Clinical symptoms of this zoonotic virus included severe fever, thrombocytopenia, and leukocytopenia, with a mortality rate of ~10%. By the end of 2011 the disease associated with this pathogen had been reported from eleven Chinese provinces and human-to-human transmission suspected. However, current understanding of the evolution and molecular epidemiology of SFTSV before and after its identification is limited. To address this we undertake phylogenetic, evolutionary and structural analyses of all available SFTSV genetic sequences, including a new SFTSV complete genome isolated from a patient from Henan in 2011. Our discovery of a mosaic L segment sequence, which is descended from two major circulating lineages of SFTSV in China, represents the first evidence that homologous recombination plays a role in SFTSV evolution. Selection analyses indicate that negative selection is predominant in SFTSV genes, yet differences in selective forces among genes are consistent between Phlebovirus species. Further analysis reveals structural conservation between SFTSV and Rift Valley fever virus in the residues of their nucleocapsids that are responsible for oligomerisation and RNA-binding, suggesting the viruses share similar modes of higher-order assembly. We reconstruct the epidemic history of SFTSV using molecular clock and coalescent-based methods, revealing that the extant SFTSV lineages originated 50-150 years ago, and that the viral population experienced a recent growth phase that concurs with and extends the earliest serological reports of SFTSV infection. Taken together, our combined structural and phylogenetic analyses shed light into the evolutionary behaviour of SFTSV in the context of other, better-known, pathogenic Phleboviruses.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

"PloS one","RNA silencing pathways play critical roles in gene regulation, virus infection, and transposon control. RNA interference (RNAi) is mediated by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which are liberated from double-stranded (ds)RNA precursors by Dicer and guide the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) to targets. Although principles governing small RNA sorting into RISC have been uncovered, the spectrum of RNA species that can be targeted by Dicer proteins, particularly the viral RNAs present during an infection, are poorly understood. Dicer-2 potently restricts viral infection in insects by generating virus-derived siRNAs from viral RNA. To better characterize the substrates of Dicer-2, we examined the virus-derived siRNAs produced during the Drosophila antiviral RNAi response to four different viruses using high-throughput sequencing. We found that each virus was uniquely targeted by the RNAi pathway; dicing substrates included dsRNA replication intermediates and intramolecular RNA stem loops. For instance, a putative intergenic RNA hairpin encoded by Rift Valley Fever virus generates abundant small RNAs in both Drosophila and mosquito cells, while repetitive sequences within the genomic termini of Vaccinia virus, which give rise to abundant small RNAs in Drosophila, were found to be transcribed in both insect and mammalian cells. Moreover, we provide evidence that the RNA species targeted by Dicer-2 can be modulated by the presence of a viral suppressor of RNAi. This study uncovered several novel, heavily targeted features within viral genomes, offering insight into viral replication, viral immune evasion strategies, and the mechanism of antiviral RNAi."
"Journal of virology","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is an emerging RNA virus with devastating economic and social consequences. Clinically, RVFV induces a gamut of symptoms ranging from febrile illness to retinitis, hepatic necrosis, hemorrhagic fever, and death. It is known that type I interferon (IFN) responses can be protective against severe pathology; however, it is unknown which innate immune receptor pathways are crucial for mounting this response. Using both in vitro assays and in vivo mucosal mouse challenge, we demonstrate here that RNA helicases are critical for IFN production by immune cells and that signaling through the helicase adaptor molecule MAVS (mitochondrial antiviral signaling) is protective against mortality and more subtle pathology during RVFV infection. In addition, we demonstrate that Toll-like-receptor-mediated signaling is not involved in IFN production, further emphasizing the importance of the RNA cellular helicases in type I IFN responses to RVFV."

"Journal of the American Mosquito Control Association","Members of the Culex pipiens complex have been implicated as vectors of a number of arboviruses including St. Louis encephalitis, West Nile, Sindbis, and Rift Valley fever viruses. For some viruses, such as West Nile virus, laboratory studies have indicated that various members of this complex have a similar ability to become infected with and transmit virus, thus providing evidence for the similarity among the various members of this complex. On the other hand, although strains of Cx. pipiens from various parts of the world have all been relatively efficient vectors of Rift Valley fever virus, Cx. quinquefasciatus from Africa, Australia, and North America have been nearly refractory to this virus, thus indicating that the various members of this complex do not necessarily respond similarly to a particular arbovirus. Based on the similar response to some viruses and differing response to others, Cx. pipiens and Cx. quinquefasciatus appear to be closely related, but distinct species."
"Journal of the American Mosquito Control Association","Mosquitoes in the Culex pipiens Complex, including Culex pipiens, Cx. quinquefasciatus, and Cx. molestus, are important pest species and vectors of human and animal diseases throughout the world's tropical, temperate, and Holarctic regions.

"Journal of virological methods","Formaldehyde is routinely used to fix tissues in preparation for pathology studies, however concerns remain that treatment of tissues with cellular fixatives may not entirely inactivate infectious virus particles. This concern is of particular regulatory importance for research involving viruses that are classified as select agents such as Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV). Therefore, the specific aims of this study were to (1) assay RVFV-exposed Aedes aegypti mosquitoes fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for the presence of infectious RVFV particles at various time points following infection and (2) demonstrate the utility of immunofluorescence assay (IFA) for the detection of RVFV antigen in various tissues of paraformaldehyde-fixed mosquitoes. Mosquitoes were administered an infectious blood meal containing one of two strains of RVFV, harvested at various time points following infection, intrathoracically inoculated with 4% paraformaldehyde, and fixed overnight at 4°C. The infection status of a subset of mosquitoes was verified by IFA on leg tissues prior to fixation, and infectivity of RVFV in fixed mosquito carcasses was determined by Vero cell plaque assay. Paraformaldehyde-fixed mosquitoes harvested 14 days post infection were also paraffin-embedded and sectioned for detection of RVFV antigen to particular tissues by IFA. None of the RVFV-exposed mosquitoes tested by Vero cell plaque assay contained infectious RVFV after fixation. Furthermore, incubation of mosquito sections with trypsin prior to antibody staining is recommended for optimal visualization of RVFV antigen in infected mosquito tissues by IFA.Published by Elsevier B.V."
"Journal of virology","Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) is a novel bunyavirus that recently emerged in China. Infection with SFTSV is associated with case-fatality rates of up to 30%, and neither antivirals nor vaccines are available at present. Development of antiviral strategies requires the elucidation of virus-host cell interactions. Here, we analyzed host cell entry of SFTSV. Employing lentiviral and rhabdoviral vectors, we found that the Gn/Gc glycoproteins (Gn/Gc) of SFTSV mediate entry into a broad range of human and animal cell lines, as well as human macrophages and dendritic cells. The Gn/Gc proteins of La Crosse virus (LACV) and Rift Valley Fever Virus (RVFV), other members of the bunyavirus family, facilitated entry into an overlapping but not identical range of cell lines, suggesting that SFTSV, LACV, and RVFV might differ in their receptor requirements. Entry driven by SFTSV Gn/Gc was dependent on low pH but did not require the activity of the pH-dependent endosomal/lysosomal cysteine proteases cathepsins B and L. Instead, the activity of a cellular serine protease was required for infection driven by SFTSV and LACV Gn/Gc. Sera from convalescent SFTS patients inhibited SFTSV Gn/Gc-driven host cell entry in a dose-dependent fashion, demonstrating that the vector system employed is suitable to detect neutralizing antibodies. Finally, the C-type lectin DC-SIGN was found to serve as a receptor for SFTSV Gn/Gc-driven entry into cell lines and dendritic cells. Our results provide initial insights into cell tropism, receptor usage, and proteolytic activation of SFTSV and will aid in the understanding of viral spread and pathogenesis."
"Bulletin of mathematical biology","Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a severe viral zoonosis in Africa and the Middle East that harms both human health and livestock production. It is believed that RVF in Egypt has been repeatedly introduced by the importation of infected animals from Sudan. In this paper, we propose a three-patch model for the process by which animals enter Egypt from Sudan, are moved up the Nile, and then consumed at population centers. The basic reproduction number for each patch is introduced and then the threshold dynamics of the model are established. We simulate an interesting scenario showing a possible explanation of the observed phenomenon of the geographic spread of RVF in Egypt."
"Lab on a chip","RNA interference (RNAi) is a powerful tool for functional genomics with the capacity to comprehensively analyze host-pathogen interactions. High-throughput RNAi screening is used to systematically perturb cellular pathways and discover therapeutic targets, but the method can be tedious and requires extensive capital equipment and expensive reagents. To aid in the development of an inexpensive miniaturized RNAi screening platform, we have developed a two part microfluidic system for patterning and screening gene targets on-chip to examine cellular pathways involved in virus entry and infection. First, a multilayer polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-based spotting device was used to array siRNA molecules into 96 microwells targeting markers of endocytosis, along with siRNA controls. By using a PDMS-based spotting device, we remove the need for a microarray printer necessary to perform previously described small scale (e.g. cellular microarrays) and microchip-based RNAi screening, while still minimizing reagent usage tenfold compared to conventional screening. Second, the siRNA spotted array was transferred to a reversibly sealed PDMS-based screening platform containing microchannels designed to enable efficient cell loading and transfection of mammalian cells while preventing cross-contamination between experimental conditions. Validation of the screening platform was examined using Vesicular stomatitis virus and emerging pathogen Rift Valley fever virus, which demonstrated virus entry pathways of clathrin-mediated endocytosis and caveolae-mediated endocytosis, respectively. The techniques here are adaptable to other well-characterized infection pathways with a potential for large scale screening in high containment biosafety laboratories."
"Virus research","The embryonated chicken egg (ECE) provides a convenient, space-saving incubator for the cultivation of many kinds of animal viruses where the egg can be easily observed for viral replication throughout the development of the chicken embryo. Within the family Bunyaviridae, the embryonated egg has been used as a host system for many viruses such as Rift Valley fever virus and Akabane virus. The current study was conducted to determine the cultivation of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) in ECE. Four-day-old eggs were infected with CCHFV via the yolk sac route and harvested embryonic tissues and amino-allantoic fluid (AAF) that were used for virus passage and viral RNA (vRNA) detection. Quantification of vRNA copies was performed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Our study indicated that CCHFV caused the death of the embryonated egg in a dose-dependent manner and the 50% egg infectious dose (EID50) was determined to be 6.47×10(5) copies/egg. CCHFV replicated and passaged well in the egg and high viral loads were detected both in embryonic tissue (10(9-10) copies/g) and AAF (10(7-9) copies/ml) of the embryonated egg. Thus, ECE could be used for viral cultivation and preservation, and as a potential host infection model for the study of the pathogenesis of CCHFV.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"Antibiotiki i khimioterapii͡a = Antibiotics and chemoterapy [sic] / Ministerstvo meditsinskoĭ i mikrobiologicheskoĭ promyshlennosti SSSR","Search for drugs efficient in prophylaxis and treatment of dangerous infections (especially arboviral ones) is rather actual, since no specific therapy is available. Many-year investigations of interferon inductors showed that they had immunomodulating, antiviral and antiinflammatory effects and were low toxic. The present study demonstrated that the protective effect was the following: Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE)--cycloferon > amixin = ridostin, Rift Valley fever (RVF)--cycloferon > amixin > ridostin, predator pox (PP)--cycloferon > amixin = ridostin, that was obvious that cycloferon was the most active agent in the treatment of VEE, RVF and PP, thus making it possible to acknowledge its priority in prophylaxis and therapy of dangerous viral infections (DVI). Ribavirin in combination with cycloferon solution or cycloferon tablets provided shorter periods of the fever, minimized the intoxication syndrome, promoted earlier resolution of hemorrhagic eruption and lowered the frequency of complications, which was in favour of the disease prognosis."
"Emerging infectious diseases","To elucidate whether Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) diversity in Sudan resulted from multiple introductions or from acquired changes over time from 1 introduction event, we generated complete genome sequences from RVFV strains detected during the 2007 and 2010 outbreaks. Phylogenetic analyses of small, medium, and large RNA segment sequences indicated several genetic RVFV variants were circulating in Sudan, which all grouped into Kenya-1 or Kenya-2 sublineages from the 2006-2008 eastern Africa epizootic. Bayesian analysis of sequence differences estimated that diversity among the 2007 and 2010 Sudan RVFV variants shared a most recent common ancestor circa 1996. The data suggest multiple introductions of RVFV into Sudan as part of sweeping epizootics from eastern Africa. The sequences indicate recent movement of RVFV and support the need for surveillance to recognize when and where RVFV circulates between epidemics, which can make data from prediction tools easier to interpret and preventive measures easier to direct toward high-risk areas."
"Emerging infectious diseases","Although Rift Valley fever is a disease that, through its wider societal effects, disproportionately affects vulnerable communities with poor resilience to economic and environmental challenge, Rift Valley fever virus has since its discovery in 1931 been neglected by major global donors and disease control programs. We describe recent outbreaks affecting humans and animals and discuss the serious socioeconomic effects on the communities affected and the slow pace of development of new vaccines. We also discuss the mixed global response, which has largely been fueled by the classification of the virus as a potential bioterrorism agent and its potential to migrate beyond its traditional eastern African boundaries. We argue for a refocus of strategy with increased global collaboration and a greater sense of urgency and investment that focuses on an equity-based approach in which funding and research are prioritized by need, inspired by principles of equity and social justice."
"Journal of clinical microbiology","Syndromic panels for infectious disease have been suggested to be of value in point-of-care diagnostics for developing countries and for biodefense. To test the performance of isothermal recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) assays, we developed a panel of 10 RPAs for biothreat agents. The panel included RPAs for Francisella tularensis, Yersinia pestis, Bacillus anthracis, variola virus, and reverse transcriptase RPA (RT-RPA) assays for Rift Valley fever virus, Ebola virus, Sudan virus, and Marburg virus. Their analytical sensitivities ranged from 16 to 21 molecules detected (probit analysis) for the majority of RPA and RT-RPA assays. A magnetic bead-based total nucleic acid extraction method was combined with the RPAs and tested using inactivated whole organisms spiked into plasma. The RPA showed comparable sensitivities to real-time RCR assays in these extracts. The run times of the assays at 42°C ranged from 6 to 10 min, and they showed no cross-detection of any of the target genomes of the panel nor of the human genome. The RPAs therefore seem suitable for the implementation of syndromic panels onto microfluidic platforms."
"The Onderstepoort journal of veterinary research","Rift Valley fever (RVF) is an acute, fever causing viral disease that affects domestic animals and humans. In Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), this pathology is not well documented. No epidemic of the RVF has not been reported but sera samples collected in six provinces surveyed from 2005 to 2006 revealed 14% of apparent prevalence and, high apparent prevalence (20%) of antibodies against RVF virus was reported in Katanga Province during the same survey; this serological evidence was associated with abortions cases in Cattle (Mulumba et al. 2009). Livestock immunisation is important for control of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) epidemics; however immunisation of susceptible domestic animals in endemic countries does not protect animals against the clinical disease but prevents the propagation of virus to human population through reduction of the amplification degree in host animals. The humoral immunity is sufficient for protection for animals as well as for humans. The infection caused by RVFV leads to neutralisation of the immunity of the animal (Barnard 1979).Various immunological studies have been made on the characterisation of immune response during RVFV epidemics but, until now several studies have been concentrated on the response of the innate immune particularly based on signal interferon system than the response of the adaptive immune and cell mediated humoral immune. The available information on the immune response related to RVFV does not seem to provide enough information on various mechanisms of the response immune system.The aim of the study is based on mechanism of immune response system including protective effect of immunisation against RVFV. In addition, epidemiological and molecular studies will be assessed. As a matter of fact, following studies will be conducted:• evaluation of the immunological protection against Rift Valley fever in vaccinated and non- vaccinated cattle using IgG and IgM ELISAs in Katanga Province• assessment of cellular response to Rift Valley fever disease in vaccinated and naturally infected cattle• molecular characterisation of RVFV strains circulating in vaccinated and non vaccinated cattle• assessment of protective effect related to vaccinal strains in cattle, using a longitudinal survey.The studies will be carried out Northern Katanga Province within two areas, one with historyof circulation of RVFV and other without history RVFV circulation.Whole blood, spleen, liver, lymph node will be collected as target tissues from cattle carcasses. In addition, goats and sheeps samples will be collected alongside from each area in order to clarify the disease situation. Serological tests based on the detection of Ig M and Ig G will be used. DIVA tests, LAMP, and IHC techniques will be used. Within previously vaccinated areas in the above mentioned areas and those that are not vaccinated, the collected samples will be analysed using RT-PCR/RT-LAMP.In vitro experimental studies systems will be carried out using animal PMBCs that will be infected with wild type of RVF virus as well as with vaccinal strains, such as clones 13 and MP12 to characterise various cell types such as CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells, B-cells, NK cells and, macrophages will be studied with regard to activation and apoptosis signals on various post - infection days, using flow cytometry. A pool of animals will be vaccinated with the Clone 13 and another with the MP12 to determine the traceability. The monitoring of the immune response will be done through the measurement of immunoglobulin G (Ig G) and immunoglobulin M (Ig M). RT-PCR, spectrophotometer or Facs methods will be used for the dosage of cells T CD4 + and Cell T CD8+."
"The Onderstepoort journal of veterinary research","A review was conducted to provide comprehensive update on Rift Valley fever (RVF) in Tanzania, with particular attention devoted to trend of occurrence, epidemiological factors, socio-economic impact and measures which were applied to its control. Information presented in this paper was obtained through extensive literature review. Rift Valley fever was documented for the first time in Tanzania in 1977. This was followed by epidemics in 1997 and 2007. Contrary to the latest epidemic in 2007 sporadic cases of RVF during the previous epidemics were confined to mainly livestock and mostly affecting northern parts of Tanzania. The latest disease epidemic expanded to cover wider areas (mostly northern and central zones) of the country involving both human and domestic ruminants. During the latest disease outbreak 52.4% (n = 21) of regions in Tanzania mainland were affected and majority (72.7, n = 11) of the regions had concurrent infections in human and animals. Phylogenetic comparison of nucleotide and amimo acid sequences revealed different virus strains between Kenya and Tanzania.Epidemiological factors that were considered responsible for the previous RVF epidemics in Tanzania included farming systems, climatic factors, vector activities and presence of large population of ruminant species, animal movements and food consumption habits. Majority of the RVF positive cases in the latest epidemic were livestock under pastoral and agro-pastoral farming systems.The disease caused serious effects on rural people's food security and household nutrition and on direct and indirect losses to livestock producers in the country. Psycho-social distress that communities went through was enormous, which involved the thinking about the loss of their family members and/or relatives, their livestock and crop production. Socially, the status of most livestock producers was eroded in their communities.Cessation of lucrative trade in ruminants resulted in serious economic losses to the populations who were totally dependent upon this income. Livestock internal market flows drastically dropped by 37% during latest epidemic. Rift Valley fever epidemics had dramatic impact of RVF outbreak on the international animal trade in which there was a 54% decline in exports equivalent to loss of $352 750.00. The estimate of loss as a result of deaths for cattle was $4 243 250.00 whereas that of goats and sheep was $2 202 467.00.Steps taken to combat epidemics included restriction of animal movements, ban of the slaughter of cattle and vaccination of livestock and health education.From past epidemics we have learnt that each subsequent outbreak had expanded to cover wider areas of the country. The disease had dramatic socio-economic impacts both at community and nation at large. The main challenges related to the control of RVF outbreaks included lack of preparedness plan for RVF, poor coordination and information transmission, limited facilities and manpower for RVF outbreak intervention. Control of the 2007 RVF epidemic was largely the result of animal and human health agencies working in an integrated manner."
"The Onderstepoort journal of veterinary research","Rift Valley fever (RVF) in Zambia was first reported in 1974 during an epizootic of cattle and sheep that occurred in parts of Central, Southern and Copperbelt Provinces. In 1990, the disease was documented in nine districts of the provinces of Zambia. In the last two decades, there have been no reports of RVF. This long period without reported clinical disease raises questions as to whether RVF is a current or just a perceived threat. To address this question, World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) disease occurrence data on RVF for the period 2005-2010 in the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) was analysed. From the analysis, it was evident that most countries that share a common border with Zambia had reported at least one occurrence of the disease during the period under review. Due to the absence of natural physical barriers between Zambia and most of her neighbours, informal livestock trade and movements is a ubiquitous reality. Analysis of the rainfall patterns also showed that Zambia received rains sufficient to support a mosquito population large enough for high risk of RVF transmission. The evidence of disease occurrence in nearby countries coupled with animal movement, and environmental risk suggests that RVF is a serious threat to Zambia. In conclusion, the current occurrence of RVF in Zambia is unclear, but there are sufficient indications that the magnitude of the circulating infection is such that capacity building in disease surveillance and courses on recognition of the disease for field staff is recommended. Given the zoonotic potential of RVF, these measures are also a prerequisite for accurate assessment of the disease burden in humans."
"The Onderstepoort journal of veterinary research","The African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) is a large wild bovid which until recently ranged across all but the driest parts of sub-Saharan Africa, and their local range being limited to about 20 km from surface water. They are of high ecological value due to their important role as bulk feeders in the grazing hierarchy. They also have high economic value, because they are one of the sought after 'Big Five' in the eco-tourism industry. In Africa, buffaloes have been recognised for some time as an important role player in the maintenance and transmission of a variety of economically important livestock diseases at the wildlife and/or livestock interface. These include African strains of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), Corridor disease (theileriosis), bovine tuberculosis and bovine brucellosis. For a number of other diseases of veterinary importance, African buffaloes may also serve as amplifier or incidental host, whereby infection with the causative pathogens may cause severe clinical signs such as death or abortion as in the case of anthrax and Rift Valley fever, or remain mild or subclinical for example heartwater. The long term health implications of most of those infections on the buffalo at a population level is usually limited, and they do not pose a threat on the population's survival. Because of their ability to harbour and transmit important diseases to livestock, their sustainable future in ecotourism, trade and transfrontier conservation projects become complex and costly and reliable diagnostic tools are required to monitor these infections in buffalo populations."
"Journal of the South African Veterinary Association","In 2008, a suspected outbreak of Rift Valley fever (RVF) was reported on a farm in the Bela-Bela area, Limpopo Province, South Africa. Seven calves died on the affected dairy farm, where no RVF vaccination programme was practised. No apparent clinical disease was reported in the other 300 cattle (33 calves included) or 200 sheep on the farm. During the outbreak, blood samples from 77.7% (233/300) of the cattle and 36.5% (73/200) of the sheep were collected on the affected farm and 55 blood samples were taken from cattle on a neighbouring farm. Eight weeks later, 78% of the cattle (234/300) and 42.5% of the sheep (85/200) were bled on the affected farm only. All sera were tested by an Immunoglobulin M (IgM)-capture Enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and by an indirect Immunoglobulin G (IgG) ELISA. Selected IgM-positive (n = 14), IgG-positive (n = 23) and samples negative for both IgM and IgG-specific antibodies against RVF virus (n = 19) were tested using the serum neutralisation test (SNT). Sera from IgM-positive (n = 14) and negative (n = 20) animals were also tested by a TaqMan polymerase chain reaction (PCR). On the affected farm, 7% (16/233) of the cattle were IgM-positive and 13.7% (32/233) IgG-positive at the first bleed and 2% were IgM-positive at the second bleed, whilst the number of cattle positive for IgG-specific antibodies increased by 21.3% compared with the first bleed. Only 1.4% of sheep were positive for both IgM and IgG antibodies at the first collection; at the second bleed, IgM-positive cases decreased to 1.2%, whilst IgG-positive cases increased to 2.4%. Whilst no IgM-positive cattle were found on the neighbouring farm, 5.5% of cattle were IgG-positive. The SNT confirmed most of the ELISA results, whilst PCR results were all negative. Although serology results indicated virus circulation on both farms, the negative PCR results demonstrated that the animals were not viraemic at the time they were sampled. The movement of infected mosquito vectors by wind over long distances into a low-lying area that favoured their breeding on the Bela-Bela farm may have led to an outbreak of the disease there, but the reason for the low level of virus circulation amongst susceptible animals remains unclear."
"PLoS neglected tropical diseases","Rift Valley fever (RVF), a mosquito-borne zoonosis, is a major public health and veterinary problem in sub-Saharan Africa. Surveillance to monitor mosquito populations during the inter-epidemic period (IEP) and viral activity in these vectors is critical to informing public health decisions for early warning and control of the disease. Using a combination of field bioassays, electrophysiological and chemical analyses we demonstrated that skin-derived aldehydes (heptanal, octanal, nonanal, decanal) common to RVF virus (RVFV) hosts including sheep, cow, donkey, goat and human serve as potent attractants for RVFV mosquito vectors. Furthermore, a blend formulated from the four aldehydes and combined with CO(2)-baited CDC trap without a light bulb doubled to tripled trap captures compared to control traps baited with CO(2) alone. Our results reveal that (a) because of the commonality of the host chemical signature required for attraction, the host-vector interaction appears to favor the mosquito vector allowing it to find and opportunistically feed on a wide range of mammalian hosts of the disease, and (b) the sensitivity, specificity and superiority of this trapping system offers the potential for its wider use in surveillance programs for RVFV mosquito vectors especially during the IEP."
"Journal of virology","Toscana virus (TOSV), which is transmitted by Phlebotomus spp. sandflies, is a major etiologic agent of aseptic meningitis and encephalitis in the Mediterranean. Like other members of the genus Phlebovirus of the family Bunyaviridae, TOSV encodes a nonstructural protein (NSs) in its small RNA segment. Although the NSs of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) has been identified as an important virulence factor, which suppresses host general transcription, inhibits transcription from the beta interferon promoter, and promotes the proteasomal degradation of double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR), little is known about the functions of NSs proteins encoded by less-pathogenic members of this genus. In this study we report that TOSV is able to downregulate PKR with similar efficiency as RVFV, while infection with the other phleboviruses-i.e., Punta Toro virus, sandfly fever Sicilian virus, or Frijoles virus-has no effect on cellular PKR levels. In contrast to RVFV, however, cellular transcription remains unaffected during TOSV infection. TOSV NSs protein promotes the proteasome-dependent downregulation of PKR and is able to interact with kinase-inactive PKR in infected cells."
"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), like many other Bunyaviridae family members, is an emerging human and animal pathogen. Bunyaviruses have an outer lipid envelope bearing two glycoproteins, G(N) and G(C), required for cell entry. Bunyaviruses deliver their genome into the host-cell cytoplasm by fusing their envelope with an endosomal membrane. The molecular mechanism of this key entry step is unknown. The crystal structure of RVFV G(C) reveals a class II fusion protein architecture found previously in flaviviruses and alphaviruses. The structure identifies G(C) as the effector of membrane fusion and provides a direct view of the membrane anchor that initiates fusion. A structure of nonglycosylated G(C) reveals an extended conformation that may represent a fusion intermediate. Unanticipated similarities between G(C) and flavivirus envelope proteins reveal an evolutionary link between the two virus families and provide insights into the organization of G(C) in the outer shell of RVFV."
"Acta tropica","In 2008-2009 a Rift Valley Fever (RVF) outbreak occurred in the Anjozorobe area, a temperate and mountainous area of the Madagascar highlands. The results of a serosurvey conducted in 2009 suggested recurrent circulation of RVF virus (RVFV) in this area and potential involvement of the cattle trade in RVFV circulation. The objective of this study was to describe the cattle trade network of the area and analyse the link between network structure and RVFV circulation. Five hundred and sixteen animals that tested negative in 2009 were sampled again in 2010. The 2009-2010 cattle-level seroconversion rate was estimated at 7% (95% CI: 5-10%). Trade data from 386 breeders of 48 villages were collected and analysed using social network analysis methodology, nodes being villages and ties being any movements of cattle connecting villages. The specific practice of cattle barter, known as kapsile, that involves frequent contacts between cattle of two breeders, was observed in addition to usual trade. Trade data were analysed using a logistic model, the occurrence of seroconversion at the village level being the outcome variable and the network centrality measures being the predictors. A negative association was observed between the occurrence of seroconversion in the village and introduction of cattle by trade (p=0.03), as well as the distance to the nearest water point (p=0.002). Conversely, the practice of kapsile, was a seroconversion risk factor (p=0.007). The kapsile practice may be the support for inter-village RVFV circulation whereas the trade network is probably rather implicated in the introduction of RVFV to the area from other parts of Madagascar. The negative association of the distance to the nearest water point suggests that after RVFV introduction, a substantial part of transmission may be due to vectors.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

"Ophthalmic research","Emergent and resurgent arthropod vector-borne diseases are major causes of systemic morbidity and death and expanding worldwide. Among them, viral and bacterial agents including West Nile virus, Dengue fever, Chikungunya, Rift Valley fever, and rickettsioses have been recently associated with an array of ocular manifestations. These include anterior uveitis, retinitis, chorioretinitis, retinal vasculitis and optic nerve involvement. Proper clinical diagnosis of any of these infectious diseases is based on epidemiological data, history, systemic symptoms and signs, and the pattern of ocular involvement. The diagnosis is usually confirmed by the detection of a specific antibody in serum. Ocular involvement associated with emergent infections usually has a self-limited course, but it can result in persistent visual impairment. There is currently no proven specific treatment for arboviral diseases, and therapy is mostly supportive. Vaccination for humans against these viruses is still in the research phase. Doxycycline is the treatment of choice for rickettsial diseases. Prevention, including public measures to reduce the number of mosquitoes and personal protection, remains the mainstay for arthropod vector disease control. Influenza A (H1N1) virus was responsible for a pandemic human influenza in 2009, and was recently associated with various posterior segment changes.Copyright © 2012 S. Karger AG, Basel."

"Vector borne and zoonotic diseases (Larchmont, N.Y.)","Serological tests are widely used for Rift Valley fever (RVF) surveillance, disease control, and monitoring of immunological responses after vaccination. In recent years, several enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) formats have been developed for the detection of antibodies to RVF virus, but limited comparisons of their diagnostic sensitivities are available for specifically-targeted animal populations. This article describes the comparison of the commercially-available RVF recombinant nucleocapsid IgG indirect ELISA with the IgG sandwich ELISA in field-collected serum samples from 1262 domestic small ruminants in Mozambique. The agreement between the two tests measured by Cohen's kappa value was high (0.99 in goats and 0.92 in sheep), but the IgG sandwich ELISA was slightly more sensitive than the recombinant nucleocapsid IgG indirect ELISA in detecting the IgG response in sheep and goats naturally exposed to RVF virus."
"Journal of virology","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a Phlebovirus (Bunyaviridae family) transmitted by mosquitoes. It infects humans and ruminants, causing dramatic epidemics and epizootics in Africa, Yemen, and Saudi Arabia. While recent studies demonstrated the importance of the nonstructural protein NSs as a major component of virulence in vertebrates, little is known about infection of mosquito vectors. Here we studied RVFV infection in three different mosquito cell lines, Aag2 cells from Aedes aegypti and U4.4 and C6/36 cells from Aedes albopictus. In contrast with mammalian cells, where NSs forms nuclear filaments, U4.4 and Aag2 cells downregulated NSs expression such that NSs filaments were never formed in nuclei of U4.4 cells and disappeared at an early time postinfection in the case of Aag2 cells. On the contrary, in C6/36 cells, NSs nuclear filaments were visible during the entire time course of infection. Analysis of virus-derived small interfering RNAs (viRNAs) by deep sequencing indicated that production of viRNAs was very low in C6/36 cells, which are known to be Dicer-2 deficient but expressed some viRNAs presenting a Piwi signature. In contrast, Aag2 and U4.4 cells produced large amounts of viRNAs predominantly matching the S segment and displaying Dicer-2 and Piwi signatures. Whereas 21-nucleotide (nt) Dicer-2 viRNAs were prominent during early infection, the population of 24- to 27-nt Piwi RNAs (piRNAs) increased progressively and became predominant later during the acute infection and during persistence. In Aag2 and U4.4 cells, the combined actions of the Dicer-2 and Piwi pathways triggered an efficient antiviral response permitting, among other actions, suppression of NSs filament formation and allowing establishment of persistence. In C6/36 cells, Piwi-mediated RNA interference (RNAi) appeared to be sufficient to mount an antiviral response against a secondary infection with a superinfecting virus. This study provides new insights into the role of Dicer and Piwi in mosquito antiviral defense and the development of the antiviral response in mosquitoes."
"Zhurnal mikrobiologii, epidemiologii, i immunobiologii","In the last quarter of century virus of Rift valley fever (RVF) sharply extended its distribution by moving from Africa to Asia and evolving from low- to high pathogenic for humans causing severe hemorrhagic disease, practically equaling in this respect with some members ofa group of extremely dangerous pathogens. Morbidity and epidemics of RVF are analyzed. Evolution of epidemic development of the infection is examined. Necessity of development of means and methods for diagnostics, prophylaxis and therapy of RVF is underlined."
"Vaccine","The safety and immunogenicity of two authentic recombinant (ar) Rift Valley fever (RVF) viruses, one with a deletion in the NSs region of the S RNA segment (arMP-12ΔNSs16/198) and the other with a large deletion of the NSm gene in the pre Gn region of the M RNA segment (arMP-12ΔNSm21/384) of the RVF MP-12 vaccine virus were tested in crossbred ewes at 30-50 days of gestation. First, we evaluated the neutralizing antibody response, measured by plaque reduction neutralization (PRNT(80)), and clinical response of the two viruses in groups of four ewes each. The virus dose was 1×10(5)plaque forming units (PFU). Control groups of four ewes each were also inoculated with a similar dose of RVF MP-12 or the parent recombinant virus (arMP-12). Neutralizing antibody was first detected in 3 of 4 animals inoculated with arMP-12ΔNSm21/384 on Day 5 post inoculation and all four animals had PRNT(80) titers of ≥1:20 on Day 6. Neutralizing antibody was first detected in 2 of 4 ewes inoculated with arMP-12ΔNSs16/198 on Day 7 and all had PRNT(80) titers of ≥1:20 on Day 10. We found the mean PRNT(80) response to arMP-12ΔNSs16/198 to be 16- to 25-fold lower than that of ewes inoculated with arMP-12ΔNSm21/384, arMP-12 or RVF MP-12. No abortions occurred though a single fetal death in each of the arMP-12 and RVF MP-12 groups was found at necropsy. The poor PRNT(80) response to arMP-12ΔNSs16/198 caused us to discontinue further testing of this candidate and focus on arMP-12ΔNSm21/384. A dose escalation study of arMP-12ΔNSm21/384 showed that 1×10(3)plaque forming units (PFU) stimulate a PRNT(80) response comparable to doses of up to 1×10(5)PFU of this virus. With further study, the arMP-12ΔNSm21/384 virus may prove to be a safe and efficacious candidate for a livestock vaccine. The large deletion in the NSm gene may also provide a negative marker that will allow serologic differentiation of naturally infected animals from vaccinated animals.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

"PLoS neglected tropical diseases","In recent years, the East African region has seen an increase in arboviral diseases transmitted by blood-feeding arthropods. Effective surveillance to monitor and reduce incidence of these infections requires the use of appropriate vector sampling tools. Here, trapped skin volatiles on fur from sheep, a known preferred host of mosquito vectors of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), were used with a standard CDC light trap to improve catches of mosquito vectors. We tested the standard CDC light trap alone (L), and baited with (a) CO(2) (LC), (b) animal volatiles (LF), and (c) CO(2) plus animal volatiles (LCF) in two highly endemic areas for RVF in Kenya (Marigat and Ijara districts) from March-June and September-December 2010. The incidence rate ratios (IRR) that mosquito species chose traps baited with treatments (LCF, LC and LF) instead of the control (L) were estimated. Marigat was dominated by secondary vectors and host-seeking mosquitoes were 3-4 times more likely to enter LC and LCF traps [IRR = 3.1 and IRR = 3.8 respectively] than the L only trap. The LCF trap captured a greater number of mosquitoes than the LC trap (IRR = 1.23) although the difference was not significant. Analogous results were observed at Ijara, where species were dominated by key primary and primary RVFV vectors, with 1.6-, 6.5-, and 8.5-fold increases in trap captures recorded in LF, LC and LCF baited traps respectively, relative to the control. These catches all differed significantly from those trapped in L only. Further, there was a significant increase in trap captures in LCF compared to LC (IRR = 1.63). Mosquito species composition and trap counts differed between the RVF sites. However, within each site, catches differed in abundance only and no species preferences were noted in the different baited-traps. Identifying the attractive components present in these natural odors should lead to development of an effective odor-bait trapping system for population density-monitoring and result in improved RVF surveillance especially during the inter-epidemic period."
"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","Rift Valley fever and Toscana viruses are human pathogens for which no effective therapeutics exist. These and other phleboviruses have segmented negative-sense RNA genomes that are sequestered by a nucleocapsid protein (N) to form ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes of irregular, asymmetric structure, previously uncharacterized at high resolution. N binds nonspecifically to single-stranded RNA with nanomolar affinity. Crystal structures of Rift Valley fever virus N-RNA complexes reconstituted with defined RNAs of different length capture tetrameric, pentameric and hexameric N-RNA multimers. All N-N subunit contacts are mediated by a highly flexible α-helical arm. Arm movement gives rise to the three multimers in the crystal structures and also explains the asymmetric architecture of the RNP. Despite the flexible association of subunits, the crystal structures reveal an invariant, monomeric RNP building block, consisting of the core of one N subunit, the arm of a neighboring N, and four RNA nucleotides with the flanking phosphates. Up to three additional RNA nucleotides bind between subunits. The monomeric building block is matched in size to the repeating unit in viral RNP, as visualized by electron microscopy. N sequesters four RNA bases in a narrow hydrophobic binding slot and has polar contacts only with the sugar-phosphate backbone, which faces the solvent. All RNA bases, whether in the binding slot or in the subunit interface, face the protein in a manner that is incompatible with base pairing or with ""reading"" by the viral polymerase."
"Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology","Rift Valley fever (RVF) is endemic to sub-Saharan Africa, and has spread into Madagascar, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen.

RVFV is classified as a Category A Priority pathogen and overlap select agent by CDC/USDA due to its potential impact on public health and agriculture. There is a gap in the safety and immunogenicity in traditional RVF vaccines; the formalin-inactivated RVFV vaccine TSI-GSD-200 requires three doses for protection, and the live-attenuated Smithburn vaccine has a risk to cause abortion and fetal malformation in pregnant ruminants. In this review, problems of traditional vaccines and the safety and efficacy of recently reported novel RVF candidate vaccines including subunit vaccines, virus vector, and replicons are discussed."
"Journal of biological dynamics","We present two ordinary differential equation models for Rift Valley fever (RVF) transmission in cattle and mosquitoes. We extend existing models for vector-borne diseases to include an asymptomatic host class and vertical transmission in vectors. We define the basic reproductive number, ℛ(0), and analyse the existence and stability of equilibrium points. We compute sensitivity indices of ℛ(0) and a reactivity index (that measures epidemicity) to parameters for baseline wet and dry season values. ℛ(0) is most sensitive to the mosquito biting and death rates. The reactivity index is most sensitive to the mosquito biting rate and the infectivity of hosts to vectors. Numerical simulations show that even with low equilibrium prevalence, increases in mosquito densities through higher rainfall, in the presence of vertical transmission, can result in large epidemics. This suggests that vertical transmission is an important factor in the size and persistence of RVF epidemics."

The C-terminal region of NSm, which contains a basic amino acid cluster and a putative transmembrane domain, targeted the protein to the mitochondrial outer membrane and exerted antiapoptotic function."
"Emerging infectious diseases","In October 2009, two-3 months after an outbreak of a febrile disease with joint pain on the eastern coast of Madagascar, we assessed serologic markers for chikungunya virus (CHIKV), dengue virus (DENV), and Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) in 1,244 pregnant women at 6 locations. In 2 eastern coast towns, IgG seroprevalence against CHIKV was 45% and 23%; IgM seroprevalence was 28% and 5%. IgG seroprevalence against DENV was 17% and 11%. No anti-DENV IgM was detected. At 4 locations, 450-1,300 m high, IgG seroprevalence against CHIKV was 0%-3%, suggesting CHIKV had not spread to higher inland-altitudes. Four women had IgG against RVFV, probably antibodies from a 2008 epidemic. Most (78%) women from coastal locations with CHIKV-specific IgG reported joint pain and stiffness; 21% reported no symptoms. CHIKV infection was significantly associated with high bodyweight. The outbreak was an isolated CHIKV epidemic without relevant DENV co-transmission."
"Virology","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) encodes one major virulence factor, the NSs protein. NSs suppresses host general transcription, including interferon (IFN)-β mRNA synthesis, and promotes degradation of the dsRNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR). We generated a novel RVFV mutant (rMP12-NSsR173A) specifically lacking the function to promote PKR degradation. rMP12-NSsR173A infection induces early phosphorylation of eIF2α through PKR activation, while retaining the function to inhibit host general transcription including IFN-β gene inhibition. MP-12 NSs but not R173A NSs binds to wt PKR. R173A NSs formed filamentous structure in nucleus in a mosaic pattern, which was distinct from MP-12 NSs filament pattern. Due to early phosphorylation of eIF2α, rMP12-NSsR173A could not efficiently accumulate viral proteins. Our results suggest that NSs-mediated host general transcription suppression occurs independently of PKR degradation, while the PKR degradation is important to inhibit the phosphorylation of eIF2α in infected cells undergoing host general transcription suppression.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

"Journal of virology","The entry of the enveloped Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) into its host cell is mediated by the viral glycoproteins Gn and Gc. We investigated the RVFV entry process and, in particular, its pH-dependent activation mechanism using our recently developed nonspreading-RVFV-particle system. Entry of the virus into the host cell was efficiently inhibited by lysosomotropic agents that prevent endosomal acidification and by compounds that interfere with dynamin- and clathrin-dependent endocytosis. Exposure of plasma membrane-bound virions to an acidic pH (<pH 6) equivalent to the pH of late endolysosomal compartments allowed the virus to bypass the endosomal route of infection. Acid exposure of virions in the absence of target membranes triggered the class II-like Gc fusion protein to form extremely stable oligomers that were resistant to SDS and temperature dissociation and concomitantly compromised virus infectivity. By targeted mutagenesis of conserved histidines in Gn and Gc, we demonstrated that mutation of a single histidine (H857) in Gc completely abrogated virus entry, as well as acid-induced Gc oligomerization. In conclusion, our data suggest that after endocytic uptake, RVFV traffics to the acidic late endolysosomal compartments, where histidine protonation drives the reorganization of the Gc fusion protein that leads to membrane fusion."
"Journal of virology","Rift Valley fever virus strain MP-12 was generated by serial plaque passages of parental strain ZH548 12 times in MRC-5 cells in the presence of a chemical mutagen, 5-fluorouracil. As a result, MP-12 encoded 4, 9, and 10 mutations in the S, M, and L segments, respectively. Among them, mutations in the M and L segments were responsible for attenuation, while the MP-12 S segment still encoded a virulent phenotype. We performed high-throughput sequencing of MP-12 vaccine, ZH548, and recombinant MP-12 (rMP-12) viruses. We found that rMP-12 contains very low numbers of viral subpopulations, while MP-12 and ZH548 contain 2 to 4 times more viral genetic subpopulations than rMP-12. MP-12 genetic subpopulations did not encode the ZH548 sequence at the 23 MP-12 consensus mutations. On the other hand, 4 and 2 mutations in M and L segments of MP-12 were found in ZH548 subpopulations. Thus, those 6 mutations were no longer MP-12-specific mutations. ZH548 encoded several unique mutations compared to other Egyptian strains, i.e., strains ZH501, ZH1776, and ZS6365. ZH548 subpopulations shared nucleotides at the mutation site common with those in the Egyptian strains, while MP-12 subpopulations did not share those nucleotides. Thus, MP-12 retains unique genetic subpopulations and has no evidence of reversion to the ZH548 sequence in the subpopulations. This study provides the first information regarding the genetic subpopulations of RVFV and shows the genetic stability of the MP-12 vaccine manufactured in MRC-5 cells."
"PloS one","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), belongs to genus Phlebovirus of the family Bunyaviridae, causes high rates of abortion and fetal malformation in infected ruminants as well as causing neurological disorders, blindness, or lethal hemorrhagic fever in humans. RVFV is classified as a category A priority pathogen and a select agent in the U.S., and currently there are no therapeutics available for RVF patients. NSs protein, a major virulence factor of RVFV, inhibits host transcription including interferon (IFN)-β mRNA synthesis and promotes degradation of dsRNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR). NSs self-associates at the C-terminus 17 aa., while NSs at aa.210-230 binds to Sin3A-associated protein (SAP30) to inhibit the activation of IFN-β promoter. Thus, we hypothesize that NSs function(s) can be abolished by truncation of specific domains, and co-expression of nonfunctional NSs with intact NSs will result in the attenuation of NSs function by dominant-negative effect. Unexpectedly, we found that RVFV NSs truncated at aa. 6-30, 31-55, 56-80, 81-105, 106-130, 131-155, 156-180, 181-205, 206-230, 231-248 or 249-265 lack functions of IFN-β mRNA synthesis inhibition and degradation of PKR. Truncated NSs were less stable in infected cells, while nuclear localization was inhibited in NSs lacking either of aa.81-105, 106-130, 131-155, 156-180, 181-205, 206-230 or 231-248. Furthermore, none of truncated NSs had exhibited significant dominant-negative functions for NSs-mediated IFN-β suppression or PKR degradation upon co-expression in cells infected with RVFV. We also found that any of truncated NSs except for intact NSs does not interact with RVFV NSs even in the presence of intact C-terminus self-association domain. Our results suggest that conformational integrity of NSs is important for the stability, cellular localization and biological functions of RVFV NSs, and the co-expression of truncated NSs does not exhibit dominant-negative phenotype."

"Biosensors & bioelectronics","A highly sensitive immunoassay based on surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectroscopy has been developed for multiplex detection of surface envelope and capsid antigens of the viral zoonotic pathogens West Nile virus (WNV) and Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV). Detection was mediated by antibody recognition using Raman reporter-coated Au nanoparticles (GNPs) and paramagnetic nanoparticles (PMPs) conjugated with polyclonal antibodies specific for each antigen target, followed by 785nm laser excitation of magnetically concentrated GNP/antigen/PMP complexes. The discrimination of WNV and RVFV antigen detection in mixed Raman spectra was achieved by SERS enhancement of Raman spectra specific for the Raman reporter dyes Infrared 792 (IR-792) and Nile Blue (NB), respectively. Assay reactions containing dilutions of both target antigens yielded a reduction in the intensification of IR-792 and NB signature spectrum peaks and provided a conservative limit of detection of ∼5fg/ml for assays conducted in phosphate buffered saline buffer (PBS) and ∼25pg/ml for assays containing PBS spiked with fetal bovine serum. Based on the inherent simplicity of the assay, magnetic capture-based SERS assays afford promise as a biosensor platform that provides high-level multiplex detection sensitivity and can be adapted for portable diagnostic applications in limited resource settings.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Because much of the data is buried in historical studies published before Independence in 1990, there is a risk of losing valuable information on which to build current and future integrated public health strategies. The purpose of this review, therefore, is to bring together these significant fragments to identify existing knowledge gaps which need to be addressed to build effective control, prevention, and even elimination strategies. The review focuses on intestinal helminthes, schistosomes/snail 'vectors', viruses (Rift Valley Fever, Crimean Congo Hemorrhagic Fever, rabies), protozoa (Leishmania, Toxoplasma, Amoeba, Giardia), bacteria (Rickettsia, Ehrlichia, Leptospira, Coxiella, Brucella, and Borrelia), fungi (Pneumocystis) and myiasis. Each NTD speaks to the possible need for surveillance and the creation of integrated disease risk maps, linking prevalence of related NTDs with environmental and ecological factors to assist control and prevention efforts. The predominance of zoonotic disease suggests a need to integrate veterinary and public health components as the national public health surveillance system is established.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

"Journal of virology","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a zoonotic pathogen capable of causing serious morbidity and mortality in both humans and livestock. The lack of efficient countermeasure strategies, the potential for dispersion into new regions, and the pathogenesis in humans and livestock make RVFV a serious public health concern. The receptors, cellular factors, and entry pathways used by RVFV and other members of the family Bunyaviridae remain largely uncharacterized. Here we provide evidence that RVFV strain MP-12 uses dynamin-dependent caveola-mediated endocytosis for cell entry. Caveolae are lipid raft domains composed of caveolin (the main structural component), cholesterol, and sphingolipids. Caveola-mediated endocytosis is responsible for the uptake of a wide variety of host ligands, as well as bacteria, bacterial toxins, and a number of viruses. To determine the cellular entry mechanism of RVFV, we used small-molecule inhibitors, RNA interference (RNAi), and dominant negative (DN) protein expression to inhibit the major mammalian cell endocytic pathways. Inhibitors and RNAi specific for macropinocytosis and clathrin-mediated endocytosis had no effect on RVFV infection. In contrast, inhibitors of caveola-mediated endocytosis, and RNAi targeted to caveolin-1 and dynamin, drastically reduced RVFV infection in multiple cell lines. Expression of DN caveolin-1 also reduced RVFV infection significantly, while expression of DN EPS15, a protein required for the assembly of clathrin-coated pits, and DN PAK-1, an obligate mediator of macropinocytosis, had no significant impact on RVFV infection. These results together suggest that the primary mechanism of RVFV MP-12 uptake is dynamin-dependent, caveolin-1-mediated endocytosis."
"PLoS neglected tropical diseases","Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a zoonotic arbovirosis for which the primary hosts are domestic livestock (cattle, sheep and goats). RVF was first described in South Africa in 1950-1951. Mechanisms for short and long distance transmission have been hypothesised, but there is little supporting evidence. Here we describe RVF occurrence and spatial distribution in South Africa in 2008-11, and investigate the presence of a contagious process in order to generate hypotheses on the different mechanisms of transmission.A total of 658 cases were extracted from World Animal Health Information Database. Descriptive statistics, epidemic curves and maps were produced. The space-time K-function was used to test for evidence of space-time interaction. Five RVF outbreak waves (one in 2008, two in 2009, one in 2010 and one in 2011) of varying duration, location and size were reported. About 70% of cases (n = 471) occurred in 2010, when the epidemic was almost country-wide. No strong evidence of space-time interaction was found for 2008 or the second wave in 2009. In the first wave of 2009, a significant space-time interaction was detected for up to one month and over 40 km. In 2010 and 2011 a significant intense, short and localised space-time interaction (up to 3 days and 15 km) was detected, followed by one of lower intensity (up to 2 weeks and 35 to 90 km).The description of the spatiotemporal patterns of RVF in South Africa between 2008 and 2011 supports the hypothesis that during an epidemic, disease spread may be supported by factors other than active vector dispersal. Limitations of under-reporting and space-time K-function properties are discussed. Further spatial analyses and data are required to explain factors and mechanisms driving RVF spread."
"Vaccine","In Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, outbreaks of Rift Valley fever (RVF) are characterized by abortions in gestating animals and high mortality rates among domestic ruminants. An immunization program using a formalin-inactivated vaccine was initiated in Mozambique in 2002 to control RVF in cattle. In this intervention, the vaccine must be transported for more than a week within the country before it can be administered to the animals, and it is practically impossible to maintain low storage temperatures during that time. Here, we evaluated the influence of transportation conditions on the efficacy of the vaccine. Sixty-three previously unvaccinated and RVF virus seronegative cattle were divided into four groups, which were given vaccine that had been stored for 1 week at 4°C (n=9, group A), at 25°C (n=8, group B), or alternating between 4 and 25°C (n=8, group C), or under the temperature conditions ordinarily occurring during transportation within Mozambique (n=38, group D). The antibody responses induced were monitored for 6-9 months and in some animals up to 21 months. Two immunizations (3 weeks apart) with the formalin-inactivated vaccine induced a long-lasting neutralizing antibody response that was still detectable up to 21 months later. The antibody titers in the animals did not differ significantly between the temperature-assigned vaccine groups A, B, and C, whereas they were significantly higher in group D. These results show that the formalin-inactivated RVF virus vaccine is stable, and, importantly, it is not adversely affected by the variation in temperature that ordinarily occurs during transport within Mozambique.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

"Parasitology","The rate of new emerging infectious diseases entering the human population has increased over the past century, with pathogens originating from animals or from products of animal origin accounting for the vast majority. Primary risk factors for the emergence and spread of emerging zoonoses include expansion and intensification of animal agriculture and long-distance live animal transport, live animal markets, bushmeat consumption and habitat destruction. Developing effective control strategies is contingent upon the ability to test causative hypotheses of disease transmission within a statistical framework. Broadly speaking, molecular phylogeography offers a framework in which specific hypotheses regarding pathogen gene flow and dispersal within an ecological context can be compared. A number of different methods has been developed for this application. Here, our intent is firstly to discuss the application of a wide variety of statistically based methods (including Bayesian reconstruction, network parsimony analysis and regression) to specific viruses (influenza, salmon anaemia virus, foot and mouth disease and Rift Valley Fever) that have been associated with animal farming/movements; and secondly to place them in the larger framework of the threat of potential zoonotic events as well as the economic and biosecurity implications of pathogen outbreaks among our animal food sources."
"PLoS neglected tropical diseases","Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a vector-borne viral zoonosis of increasing global importance. RVF virus (RVFV) is transmitted either through exposure to infected animals or through bites from different species of infected mosquitoes, mainly of Aedes and Culex genera. These mosquitoes are very sensitive to environmental conditions, which may determine their presence, biology, and abundance. In East Africa, RVF outbreaks are known to be closely associated with heavy rainfall events, unlike in the semi-arid regions of West Africa where the drivers of RVF emergence remain poorly understood. The assumed importance of temporary ponds and rainfall temporal distribution therefore needs to be investigated.A hydrological model is combined with a mosquito population model to predict the abundance of the two main mosquito species (Aedes vexans and Culex poicilipes) involved in RVFV transmission in Senegal. The study area is an agropastoral zone located in the Ferlo Valley, characterized by a dense network of temporary water ponds which constitute mosquito breeding sites. The hydrological model uses daily rainfall as input to simulate variations of pond surface areas. The mosquito population model is mechanistic, considers both aquatic and adult stages and is driven by pond dynamics. Once validated using hydrological and entomological field data, the model was used to simulate the abundance dynamics of the two mosquito species over a 43-year period (1961-2003). We analysed the predicted dynamics of mosquito populations with regards to the years of main outbreaks. The results showed that the main RVF outbreaks occurred during years with simultaneous high abundances of both species.Our study provides for the first time a mechanistic insight on RVFV transmission in West Africa. It highlights the complementary roles of Aedes vexans and Culex poicilipes mosquitoes in virus transmission, and recommends the identification of rainfall patterns favourable for RVFV amplification."
"Computational and mathematical methods in medicine","As a category A agent in the Center for Disease Control bioterrorism list, Rift Valley fever (RVF) is considered a major threat to the United States (USA). Should the pathogen be intentionally or unintentionally introduced to the continental USA, there is tremendous potential for economic damages due to loss of livestock, trade restrictions, and subsequent food supply chain disruptions. We have incorporated the effects of space into a mathematical model of RVF in order to study the dynamics of the pathogen spread as affected by the movement of humans, livestock, and mosquitoes. The model accounts for the horizontal transmission of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) between two mosquito and one livestock species, and mother-to-offspring transmission of virus in one of the mosquito species. Space effects are introduced by dividing geographic space into smaller patches and considering the patch-to-patch movement of species. For each patch, a system of ordinary differential equations models fractions of populations susceptible to, incubating, infectious with, or immune to RVFV. The main contribution of this work is a methodology for analyzing the likelihood of pathogen establishment should an introduction occur into an area devoid of RVF. Examples are provided for general and specific cases to illustrate the methodology."
"Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology","Humans infected with Rift Valley Fever Virus (RVFV) generally recover after a febrile illness; however, a proportion of patients progress to a more severe clinical outcome such as hemorrhagic fever or meningoencephalitis. RVFV is naturally transmitted to livestock and humans by mosquito bites, but it is also infectious through inhalational exposure, making it a potential bioterror weapon. To better understand the disease caused by inhalation of RVFV, Wistar-Furth, ACI, or Lewis rats were exposed to experimental aerosols containing virulent RVFV. Wistar-Furth rats developed a rapidly progressing lethal hepatic disease after inhalational exposure; ACI rats were 100-fold less susceptible and developed fatal encephalitis after infection. Lewis rats, which do not succumb to parenteral inoculation with RVFV, developed fatal encephalitis after aerosol infection. RVFV was found in the liver, lung, spleen, heart, kidney and brain of Wistar Furth rats that succumbed after aerosol exposure. In contrast, RVFV was found only in the brains of ACI or Lewis rats that succumbed after aerosol exposure. Lewis rats that survived s.c. infection were not protected against subsequent re-challenge by aerosol exposure to the homologous virus. This is the first side-by-side comparison of the lethality and pathogenesis of RVFV in three rat strains after aerosol exposure and the first step toward developing a rodent model suitable for use under the FDA Animal Rule to test potential vaccines and therapeutics for aerosol exposure to RVFV."
"Journal of virology","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a highly pathogenic Phlebovirus that infects humans and ruminants. Initially confined to Africa, RVFV has spread outside Africa and presently represents a high risk to other geographic regions. It is responsible for high fatality rates in sheep and cattle. In humans, RVFV can induce hepatitis, encephalitis, retinitis, or fatal hemorrhagic fever. The nonstructural NSs protein that is the major virulence factor is found in the nuclei of infected cells where it associates with cellular transcription factors and cofactors. In previous work, we have shown that NSs interacts with the promoter region of the beta interferon gene abnormally maintaining the promoter in a repressed state. In this work, we performed a genome-wide analysis of the interactions between NSs and the host genome using a genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with promoter sequence microarray, the ChIP-on-chip technique. Several cellular promoter regions were identified as significantly interacting with NSs, and the establishment of NSs interactions with these regions was often found linked to deregulation of expression of the corresponding genes. Among annotated NSs-interacting genes were present not only genes regulating innate immunity and inflammation but also genes regulating cellular pathways that have not yet been identified as targeted by RVFV. Several of these pathways, such as cell adhesion, axonal guidance, development, and coagulation were closely related to RVFV-induced disorders. In particular, we show in this work that NSs targeted and modified the expression of genes coding for coagulation factors, demonstrating for the first time that this hemorrhagic virus impairs the host coagulation cascade at the transcriptional level."
"The Journal of biological chemistry","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is an arbovirus that is classified as a select agent, an emerging infectious virus, and an agricultural pathogen. Understanding RVFV-host interactions is imperative to the design of novel therapeutics. Here, we report that an infection by the MP-12 strain of RVFV induces phosphorylation of the p65 component of the NFκB cascade. We demonstrate that phosphorylation of p65 (serine 536) involves phosphorylation of IκBα and occurs through the classical NFκB cascade. A unique, low molecular weight complex of the IKK-β subunit can be observed in MP-12-infected cells, which we have labeled IKK-β2. The IKK-β2 complex retains kinase activity and phosphorylates an IκBα substrate. Inhibition of the IKK complex using inhibitors impairs viral replication, thus alluding to the requirement of an active IKK complex to the viral life cycle. Curcumin strongly down-regulates levels of extracellular infectious virus. Our data demonstrated that curcumin binds to and inhibits kinase activity of the IKK-β2 complex in infected cells. Curcumin partially exerts its inhibitory influence on RVFV replication by interfering with IKK-β2-mediated phosphorylation of the viral protein NSs and by altering the cell cycle of treated cells. Curcumin also demonstrated efficacy against ZH501, the fully virulent version of RVFV. Curcumin treatment down-regulated viral replication in the liver of infected animals. Our data point to the possibility that RVFV infection may result in the generation of novel versions of host components (such as IKK-β2) that, by virtue of altered protein interaction and function, qualify as unique therapeutic targets."
"Virus research","Diagnostic methods allowing for rapid identification of pathogens are crucial for controlling and preventing dissemination after disease outbreaks as well as for use in surveillance programs. For arboviruses, detection of the presence of virus in their arthropod hosts is important for monitoring of viral activity and quantitative information is useful for modeling of transmission dynamics. In this study, molecular detection of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) in mosquito samples from the 2006 to 2007 East African outbreaks was performed using quantitative real-time PCR assay (qRT-PCR). Specific RVFV sequence-based primer/fluorogenic (TaqMan) probe sets were derived from the L and S RNA segments of the virus. Both primer-probe L and S segment-based combinations detected genomic RVFV sequences, with generally comparable levels of sensitivity. Viral loads from three mosquito species, Aedes mcintoshi, Aedes ochraceus and Mansonia uniformis were estimated and significant differences of between 5- and 1000-fold were detected between Ae. mcintoshi and M. uniformis using both the L and S primer-probe-based assays. The genetic relationships of the viral sequences in mosquito samples were established by partial M segment sequencing and assigned to the two previously described viral lineages defined by analysis of livestock isolates obtained during the 2006-2007 outbreak, confirming that similar viruses were present in both the vector and mammalian host. The data confirms the utility of qRT-PCR for identification and initial quantification of virus in mosquito samples during RVFV outbreaks.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"Virology journal","Rift Valley Fever is an infectious viral disease and an emerging problem in many countries of Africa and on the Arabian Peninsula. The causative virus is predominantly transmitted by mosquitoes and high mortality and abortion rates characterize outbreaks in animals while symptoms ranging from mild to life-threatening encephalitis and hemorrhagic fever are noticed among infected humans. For a better prevention and treatment of the infection, an increased knowledge of the infectious process of the virus is required. The focus of this work was to identify protein-protein interactions between the non-structural protein (NSm), encoded by the M-segment of the virus, and host cell proteins. This study was initiated by screening approximately 26 million cDNA clones of a mouse embryonic cDNA library for interactions with the NSm protein using a yeast two-hybrid system. We have identified nine murine proteins that interact with NSm protein of Rift Valley Fever virus, and the putative protein-protein interactions were confirmed by growth selection procedures and β-gal activity measurements. Our results suggest that the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor subunit 2 (Cpsf2), the peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (cyclophilin)-like 2 protein (Ppil2), and the synaptosome-associated protein of 25 kDa (SNAP-25) are the most promising targets for the NSm protein of the virus during an infection."
"Frontiers in microbiology","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a bunyavirus endemic to Africa and the Arabian Peninsula that infects humans and livestock. The virus encodes two glycoproteins, Gn and Gc, which represent the major structural antigens and are responsible for host cell receptor binding and fusion. Both glycoproteins are organized on the virus surface as cylindrical hollow spikes that cluster into distinct capsomers with the overall assembly exhibiting an icosahedral symmetry. Currently, no experimental three-dimensional structure for any entire bunyavirus glycoprotein is available. Using fold recognition, we generated molecular models for both RVFV glycoproteins and found significant structural matches between the RVFV Gn protein and the influenza virus hemagglutinin protein and a separate match between RVFV Gc protein and Sindbis virus envelope protein E1. Using these models, the potential interaction and arrangement of both glycoproteins in the RVFV particle was analyzed, by modeling their placement within the cryo-electron microscopy density map of RVFV. We identified four possible arrangements of the glycoproteins in the virion envelope. Each assembly model proposes that the ectodomain of Gn forms the majority of the protruding capsomer and that Gc is involved in formation of the capsomer base. Furthermore, Gc is suggested to facilitate intercapsomer connections. The proposed arrangement of the two glycoproteins on the RVFV surface is similar to that described for the alphavirus E1-E2 proteins. Our models will provide guidance to better understand the assembly process of phleboviruses and such structural studies can also contribute to the design of targeted antivirals."
"Antiviral research","A key aspect of the infectious cycle of many viruses is the transport of specific viral proteins into the host cell nucleus to perturb the antiviral response. Examples include a number of RNA viruses that are significant human pathogens, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1, influenza A, dengue, respiratory syncytial virus and rabies, as well agents that predominantly infect livestock, such as Rift valley fever virus and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus. Inhibiting the nuclear trafficking of viral proteins as a therapeutic strategy offers an attractive possibility, with important recent progress having been made with respect to HIV-1 and dengue. The results validate nuclear protein import as an antiviral target, and suggest the identification and development of nuclear transport inhibitors as a viable therapeutic approach for a range of human and zoonotic pathogenic viruses.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

"Antiviral research","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), a member of the family Bunyaviridae, genus Phlebovirus, is the causative agent of Rift Valley fever (RVF), a mosquito-borne disease of ruminant animals and humans. The generation of a large sequence database has facilitated studies of the evolution and spread of the virus. Bayesian analyses indicate that currently circulating strains of RVFV are descended from an ancestral species that emerged from a natural reservoir in Africa when large-scale cattle and sheep farming were introduced during the 19th century. Viruses descended from multiple lineages persist in that region, through infection of reservoir animals and vertical transmission in mosquitoes, emerging in years of heavy rainfall to cause epizootics and epidemics. On a number of occasions, viruses from these lineages have been transported outside the enzootic region through the movement of infected animals or mosquitoes, triggering outbreaks in countries such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Mauritania and Madagascar, where RVF had not previously been seen. Such viruses could potentially become established in their new environments through infection of wild and domestic ruminants and other animals and vertical transmission in local mosquito species. Despite their extensive geographic dispersion, all strains of RVFV remain closely related at the nucleotide and amino acid level. The high degree of conservation of genes encoding the virion surface glycoproteins suggests that a single vaccine should protect against all currently circulating RVFV strains. Similarly, preservation of the sequence of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase across viral lineages implies that antiviral drugs targeting the enzyme should be effective against all strains. Researchers should be encouraged to collect additional RVFV isolates and perform whole-genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis, so as to enhance our understanding of the continuing evolution of this important virus. This review forms part of a series of invited papers in Antiviral Research on the genetic diversity of emerging viruses.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"PloS one","West Nile fever (WNF) and Rift Valley fever (RVF) are emerging diseases causing epidemics outside their natural range of distribution. West Nile virus (WNV) circulates widely and harmlessly in the old world among birds as amplifying hosts, and horses and humans as accidental dead-end hosts. Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) re-emerges periodically in Africa causing massive outbreaks. In the Maghreb, eco-climatic and entomologic conditions are favourable for WNV and RVFV emergence. Both viruses are transmitted by mosquitoes belonging to the Culex pipiens complex. We evaluated the ability of different populations of Cx. pipiens from North Africa to transmit WNV and the avirulent RVFV Clone 13 strain. Mosquitoes collected in Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia during the summer 2010 were experimentally infected with WNV and RVFV Clone 13 strain at titers of 10(7.8) and 10(8.5) plaque forming units/mL, respectively. Disseminated infection and transmission rates were estimated 14-21 days following the exposure to the infectious blood-meal. We show that 14 days after exposure to WNV, all mosquito st developed a high disseminated infection and were able to excrete infectious saliva. However, only 69.2% of mosquito strains developed a disseminated infection with RVFV Clone 13 strain, and among them, 77.8% were able to deliver virus through saliva. Thus, Cx. pipiens from the Maghreb are efficient experimental vectors to transmit WNV and to a lesser extent, RVFV Clone 13 strain. The epidemiologic importance of our findings should be considered in the light of other parameters related to mosquito ecology and biology."
"Virology","Detailed ultrastructural studies of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) in the mouse model are needed to develop and characterize a small animal model of RVF for the evaluation of potential vaccines and therapeutics. In this study, the ultrastructural features of RVFV infection in the mouse model were analyzed. The main changes in the liver included the presence of viral particles in hepatocytes and hepatic stem cells accompanied by hepatocyte apoptosis. However, viral particles were observed rarely in the liver; in contrast, particles were extremely abundant in the CNS. Despite extensive lymphocytolysis, direct evidence of viral replication was not observed in the lymphoid tissue. These results correlate with the acute-onset hepatitis and delayed-onset encephalitis that are dominant features of severe human RVF, but suggest that host immune-mediated mechanisms contribute significantly to pathology. The results of this study expand our knowledge of RVFV-host interactions and further characterize the mouse model of RVF.Published by Elsevier Inc."

Several RT enzymes were tested and the best sensitivity was achieved using Transcriptor (Roche). Finally an RT-RPA pellet containing a recombinant MuLV was tested in RVFV one-step-RT-RPA.The one-step-RT-RPA assay showed a sensitivity of 19 molecules detected as determined by probit analysis of eight runs using a RVFV S-segment based quantitative RNA standard and detected 20 different RVFV strains. The assays showed no cross detection of the human genome and several agents of a typical biothreat panel. It performed almost as good as the assay using glycerol buffer based Transcriptor albeit at a cost of 1-log(10) step in sensitivity.

"Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry letters","A series of acylthiourea derivatives were designed, synthesized, and evaluated for broad-spectrum antiviral activity with selected viruses from Poxviridae (vaccinia virus) and two different genera of the family Bunyaviridae (Rift Valley fever and La Crosse viruses). A compound selected from a library screen, compound 1, displayed submicromolar antiviral activity against both vaccinia virus (EC(50)=0.25 μM) and La Crosse virus (EC(50)=0.27 μM) in cytopathic effect (CPE) assays. SAR analysis was performed to further improve antiviral potency and to optimize drug-like properties of the initial hits. During our analysis, we identified 26, which was found to be nearly fourfold more potent than 1 against both vaccinia and La Crosse viruses. Selected compounds were further tested to more fully characterize the spectrum of antiviral activity. Many of these possessed single digit micromolar and sub-micromolar antiviral activity against a diverse array of targets, including influenza virus (Orthomyxoviridae), Tacaribe virus (Arenaviridae), and dengue virus (Flaviviridae).Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Currently, there is no proven effective treatment for RVFV infection, and there is no licensed vaccine. Inhibition of RNA binding to the essential viral nucleocapsid (N) protein represents a potential antiviral therapeutic strategy because all of the functions performed by N during infection involve RNA binding. To target this interaction, we developed a fluorescence polarization-based high-throughput drug-screening assay and tested 26 424 chemical compounds for their ability to disrupt an N-RNA complex.

"Geospatial health","The rapid spread of West Nile virus across North America after its introduction in 1999 highlights the potential for foreign arboviruses to become established in the United States of America. Of particular concern is Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), which has been responsible for multiple African epidemics resulting in death of both humans and livestock, as well as major economic disruption due to livestock loss and trade restrictions. Modern globalization, travel, and commerce allow viruses to easily jump from one continent to another; and it is likely only a matter of time before RVFV reaches North American shores. We used a degree-day model in combination with livestock population data and a pathways analysis to identify regions and times where RVFV is most likely to enter and become established in the United States of America. Transmission risk of the disease varies across the country from 325 annual risk days in parts of Florida to zero risk days in the far North and in high mountain regions. Areas of particular concern are where there are a high number of possible tranmission days, a large livestock population, and proximity to likely locations for the disease to enter the country via mosquito vector or human host. These areas should be monitored closely during transmission ""risk seasons"" so that if the virus does enter the country and begins to become established, it can be quickly controlled and eliminated before spreading further. Areas most at risk include the Baltimore and New York City metro areas as well as much of the region between these urban centers; most of Texas, especially around Houston; Florida; Atlanta; southwest Nebraska; southern California and Arizona; and the central valley of California."
"Journal of clinical virology : the official publication of the Pan American Society for Clinical Virology","Rift Valley fever (RVF) is an emerging arthropod-borne zoonoses of global agricultural and public health importance. In December 2006, an RVF outbreak was recognized in Kenya which led to the deployment of international response laboratory teams to the area.A field laboratory was operated in Malindi, Kenya to provide safe sample handling and molecular testing for RVF virus (RVFV) as well as selected other pathogens for differential diagnosis.Safe sample handling was carried out using a negative pressure flexible film isolator (glovebox) and commercial reagents to inactivate clinical specimens and purify nucleic acid. Whole blood was routinely used for diagnostic testing although paired plasma samples were also tested in select cases. Subsequently, human macrophages were tested in vitro for their susceptibility to RVFV.The field laboratory received samples from 33 individuals and a definite laboratory diagnosis was provided in 16 of these cases. Using molecular diagnostic techniques, RVFV was more consistently detected in whole blood than in plasma samples most likely due to association of RVFV with blood cells. Subsequent in vitro studies identified macrophages as a target cell for RVFV replication.RVFV appears to replicate in blood cells such as macrophages. Thus, the sensitivity of molecular diagnostic testing is improved if whole blood is used as the clinical specimen rather than plasma or serum.Published by Elsevier B.V."
"Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy","Punta Toro virus (PTV; Bunyaviridae, Phlebovirus) is related to Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), a pathogenic agent which causes severe disease in humans and livestock primarily in the sub-Saharan region of Africa. The recent range expansion of RVFV and the potential for its intentional release into naïve populations pose a significant threat to public health and agriculture. Studies modeling disease in rodents and nonhuman primates have shown that PTV and RVFV are highly sensitive to the antiviral effects of alpha interferon (IFN-α), an important component of the innate antiviral host response. While recombinant IFN-α has high therapeutic value, its utility for the treatment of neglected tropical diseases is hindered by its short in vivo half-life and costly production of longer-lasting pegylated IFNs. Here, we demonstrate extended preexposure protection against lethal PTV challenge following a single intranasal administration of DEF201, which is a replication-deficient human adenovirus type 5 vector engineered to constitutively express consensus IFN-α (cIFN-α) from transduced host cells. DEF201 was also efficacious when administered within 24 h as a postexposure countermeasure. Serum concentrations of cIFN-α could be detected as early as 8 h following treatment and persisted for more than 1 week. The prolonged antiphlebovirus prophylactic effect, low production costs, and ease of administration make DEF201 a promising agent for intervention during natural disease outbreaks and for countering possible bioterrorist acts."
"Emerging infectious diseases","As further confirmation of a first human case of Rift Valley fever in 2007 in Comoros, we isolated Rift Valley fever virus in suspected human cases. These viruses are genetically closely linked to the 2006-2007 isolates from Kenya."
"Parasites & vectors","Mosquitoes' response to artificial lights including color has been exploited in trap designs for improved sampling of mosquito vectors. Earlier studies suggest that mosquitoes are attracted to specific wavelengths of light and thus the need to refine techniques to increase mosquito captures following the development of super-bright light-emitting diodes (LEDs) which emit narrow wavelengths of light or very specific colors. Therefore, we investigated if LEDs can be effective substitutes for incandescent lamps used in CDC light traps for mosquito surveillance, and if so, determine the best color for attraction of important Rift Valley Fever (RFV) vectors.The efficiency of selected colored LED CDC light traps (red, green, blue, violet, combination of blue-green-red (BGR)) to sample RVF vectors was evaluated relative to incandescent light (as control) in a CDC light trap in two RVF hotspots (Marigat and Ijara districts) in Kenya. In field experiments, traps were baited with dry ice and captures evaluated for Aedes tricholabis, Ae. mcintoshi, Ae. ochraceus, Mansonia uniformis, Mn. africana and Culex pipiens, following Latin square design with days as replicates. Daily mosquito counts per treatment were analyzed using a generalized linear model with Negative Binomial error structure and log link using R. The incidence rate ratios (IRR) that mosquito species chose other treatments instead of the control, were estimated.Seasonal preference of Ae.mcintoshi and Ae. ochraceus at Ijara was evident with a bias towards BGR and blue traps respectively in one trapping period but this pattern waned during another period at same site with significantly low numbers recorded in all colored traps except blue relative to the control. Overall results showed that higher captures of all species were recorded in control traps compared to the other LED traps (IRR < 1) although only significantly different from red and violet.Based on our trapping design and color, none of the LEDs outcompeted the standard incandescent light. The data however provides preliminary evidence that a preference might exist for some of these mosquito species based on observed differential attraction to these light colors requiring future studies to compare reflected versus transmitted light and the incorporation of colored light of varying intensities."
"Emerging infectious diseases","Rift Valley fever threatens human and animal health. After a human case was confirmed in Comoros in 2007, 4 serosurveys among ruminants in Mayotte suggested that Rift Valley fever virus had been circulating at low levels since 2004, although no clinical cases occurred in animals. Entomologic and ecologic studies will help determine outbreak potential."
"PloS one","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is an emerging viral zoonosis that is responsible for devastating outbreaks among livestock and is capable of causing potentially fatal disease in humans. Studies have shown that upon infection, certain viruses have the capability of utilizing particular cellular signaling pathways to propagate viral infection. Activation of p53 is important for the DNA damage signaling cascade, initiation of apoptosis, cell cycle arrest and transcriptional regulation of multiple genes. The current study focuses on the role of p53 signaling in RVFV infection and viral replication. These results show an up-regulation of p53 phosphorylation at several serine sites after RVFV MP-12 infection that is highly dependent on the viral protein NSs. qRT-PCR data showed a transcriptional up-regulation of several p53 targeted genes involved in cell cycle and apoptosis regulation following RVFV infection. Cell viability assays demonstrate that loss of p53 results in less RVFV induced cell death. Furthermore, decreased viral titers in p53 null cells indicate that RVFV utilizes p53 to enhance viral production. Collectively, these experiments indicate that the p53 signaling pathway is utilized during RVFV infection to induce cell death and increase viral production."
"Journal of virology","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), belonging to the genus Phlebovirus, family Bunyaviridae, is endemic to sub-Saharan Africa and causes a high rate of abortion in ruminants and hemorrhagic fever, encephalitis, or blindness in humans. MP-12 is the only RVFV strain excluded from the select-agent rule and handled at a biosafety level 2 (BSL2) laboratory. MP-12 encodes a functional major virulence factor, the NSs protein, which contributes to its residual virulence in pregnant ewes. We found that 100% of mice subcutaneously vaccinated with recombinant MP-12 (rMP12)-murine PKRN167 (mPKRN167), which encodes a dominant-negative form of mouse double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-dependent protein kinase (PKR) in place of NSs, were protected from wild-type (wt) RVFV challenge, while 72% of mice vaccinated with MP-12 were protected after challenge. rMP12-mPKRN167 induced alpha interferon (IFN-α) in sera, accumulated RVFV antigens in dendritic cells at the local draining lymph nodes, and developed high levels of neutralizing antibodies, while parental MP-12 induced neither IFN-α nor viral-antigen accumulation at the draining lymph node yet induced a high level of neutralizing antibodies. The present study suggests that the expression of a dominant-negative PKR increases the immunogenicity and efficacy of live-attenuated RVFV vaccine, which will lead to rational design of safe and highly immunogenic RVFV vaccines for livestock and humans."
"Acta tropica","The objective of the present study was to measure seroepidemiology of Rift Valley Fever virus infection in the Southwestern regions of Saudi Arabia and to determine the potential risk factors leading to Rift Valley Fever virus infection. Through a series of field trips to the study area (Jizan, Aseer and Al-Qunfuda), a random sample of the general population (patients and their relatives) attending the outpatients' clinics for any reasons were included. Through questionnaire interviews, data were collected regarding their sociodemographic status, housing conditions, animal contact and other relevant information. Blood samples were taken and tested for RVF-specific IgG and IgM utilizing commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). Out of 2322 persons included in the study, only 139 were positive for RVF-specific IgG thus giving an overall prevalence of 6.0%. On the other hand, none of the study samples were found to be sero-positive to RVF-specific IgM. The study revealed zero prevalence of specific IgM and IgG among pre-school children born after the 2000-2001 outbreaks. Using multivariate binary logistic regression analysis to identify potential risk factors associated with sero-positive RVF IgG, the following significant risk factors were identified: lack of electricity, having animals in the house, history of slaughtering animals, contact with or transporting aborted animals. The study documented the lack of recent RVF activity among humans in the study areas since the outbreak of 2000 and therefore, the rigorous control measures undertaken together with fostering public health messages in the region should be maintained to reduce the risk of animal-to-human transmission as a result of unsafe animal husbandry and slaughtering practices.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

"Journal of theoretical biology","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) has been expanding its geographical distribution with important implications for both human and animal health. The emergence of Rift Valley fever (RVF) in the Middle East, and its continuing presence in many areas of Africa, has negatively impacted both medical and veterinary infrastructures and human morbidity, mortality, and economic endpoints. Furthermore, worldwide attention should be directed towards the broader infection dynamics of RVFV, because suitable host, vector and environmental conditions for additional epidemics likely exist on other continents; including Asia, Europe and the Americas. We propose a new compartmentalized model of RVF and the related ordinary differential equations to assess disease spread in both time and space; with the latter driven as a function of contact networks. Humans and livestock hosts and two species of vector mosquitoes are included in the model. The model is based on weighted contact networks, where nodes of the networks represent geographical regions and the weights represent the level of contact between regional pairings for each set of species. The inclusion of human, animal, and vector movements among regions is new to RVF modeling. The movement of the infected individuals is not only treated as a possibility, but also an actuality that can be incorporated into the model. We have tested, calibrated, and evaluated the model using data from the recent 2010 RVF outbreak in South Africa as a case study; mapping the epidemic spread within and among three South African provinces. An extensive set of simulation results shows the potential of the proposed approach for accurately modeling the RVF spreading process in additional regions of the world. The benefits of the proposed model are twofold: not only can the model differentiate the maximum number of infected individuals among different provinces, but also it can reproduce the different starting times of the outbreak in multiple locations. Finally, the exact value of the reproduction number is numerically computed and upper and lower bounds for the reproduction number are analytically derived in the case of homogeneous populations.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

"PLoS neglected tropical diseases","Rift Valley fever virus is an arthropod-borne human and animal pathogen responsible for large outbreaks of acute and febrile illness throughout Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. Reverse genetics technology has been used to develop deletion mutants of the virus that lack the NSs and/or NSm virulence genes and have been shown to be stable, immunogenic and protective against Rift Valley fever virus infection in animals. We assessed the potential for these deletion mutant viruses to infect and be transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, which are the principal vectors for maintenance of the virus in nature and emergence of virus initiating disease outbreaks, and by Culex mosquitoes which are important amplification vectors.Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes were fed bloodmeals containing the deletion mutant viruses. Two weeks post-exposure mosquitoes were assayed for infection, dissemination, and transmission. In Ae. aegypti, infection and transmission rates of the NSs deletion virus were similar to wild type virus while dissemination rates were significantly reduced. Infection and dissemination rates for the NSm deletion virus were lower compared to wild type. Virus lacking both NSs and NSm failed to infect Ae. aegypti. In Cx. quinquefasciatus, infection rates for viruses lacking NSm or both NSs and NSm were lower than for wild type virus.In both species, deletion of NSm or both NSs and NSm reduced the infection and transmission potential of the virus. Deletion of both NSs and NSm resulted in the highest level of attenuation of virus replication. Deletion of NSm alone was sufficient to nearly abolish infection in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, indicating an important role for this protein. The double deleted viruses represent an ideal vaccine profile in terms of environmental containment due to lack of ability to efficiently infect and be transmitted by mosquitoes."
"PLoS neglected tropical diseases","Rift Valley fever (RVF), a re-emerging mosquito-borne disease of ruminants and man, was endemic in Africa but spread to Saudi Arabia and Yemen, meaning it could spread even further. Little is known about innate and cell-mediated immunity to RVF virus (RVFV) in ruminants, which is knowledge required for adequate vaccine trials. We therefore studied these aspects in experimentally infected goats. We also compared RVFV grown in an insect cell-line and that grown in a mammalian cell-line for differences in the course of infection. Goats developed viremia one day post infection (DPI), which lasted three to four days and some goats had transient fever coinciding with peak viremia. Up to 4% of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were positive for RVFV. Monocytes and dendritic cells in PBMCs declined possibly from being directly infected with virus as suggested by in vitro exposure. Infected goats produced serum IFN-γ, IL-12 and other proinflammatory cytokines but not IFN-α. Despite the lack of IFN-α, innate immunity via the IL-12 to IFN-γ circuit possibly contributed to early protection against RVFV since neutralising antibodies were detected after viremia had cleared. The course of infection with insect cell-derived RVFV (IN-RVFV) appeared to be different from mammalian cell-derived RVFV (MAM-RVFV), with the former attaining peak viremia faster, inducing fever and profoundly affecting specific immune cell subpopulations. This indicated possible differences in infections of ruminants acquired from mosquito bites relative to those due to contact with infectious material from other animals. These differences need to be considered when testing RVF vaccines in laboratory settings."
"PloS one","Rift Valley Fever (RVF) virus (Family Bunyaviridae) is an arthropod-borne RNA virus that infects primarily domestic ruminants and occasionally humans. RVF epizootics are characterized by numerous abortions and mortality among young animals. In humans, the illness is usually characterized by a mild self-limited febrile illness, which could progress to more serious complications. RVF virus is widespread and endemic in many regions of Africa. In Western Africa, several outbreaks have been reported since 1987 when the first major one occurred at the frontier of Senegal and Mauritania. Aiming to evaluate the spreading and molecular epidemiology in these countries, RVFV isolates from 1944 to 2008 obtained from 18 localities in Senegal and Mauritania and 15 other countries were investigated. Our results suggest that a more intense viral activity possibly took place during the last century compared to the recent past and that at least 5 introductions of RVFV took place in Senegal and Mauritania from distant African regions. Moreover, Barkedji in Senegal was possibly a hub associated with the three distinct entries of RVFV in West Africa."
"PLoS pathogens","The cell intrinsic innate immune responses provide a first line of defense against viral infection, and often function by targeting cellular pathways usurped by the virus during infection. In particular, many viruses manipulate cellular lipids to form complex structures required for viral replication, many of which are dependent on de novo fatty acid synthesis. We found that the energy regulator AMPK, which potently inhibits fatty acid synthesis, restricts infection of the Bunyavirus, Rift Valley Fever Virus (RVFV), an important re-emerging arthropod-borne human pathogen for which there are no effective vaccines or therapeutics. We show restriction of RVFV both by AMPK and its upstream activator LKB1, indicating an antiviral role for this signaling pathway. Furthermore, we found that AMPK is activated during RVFV infection, leading to the phosphorylation and inhibition of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, the first rate-limiting enzyme in fatty acid synthesis. Activating AMPK pharmacologically both restricted infection and reduced lipid levels. This restriction could be bypassed by treatment with the fatty acid palmitate, demonstrating that AMPK restricts RVFV infection through its inhibition of fatty acid biosynthesis. Lastly, we found that this pathway plays a broad role in antiviral defense since additional viruses from disparate families were also restricted by AMPK and LKB1. Therefore, AMPK is an important component of the cell intrinsic immune response that restricts infection through a novel mechanism involving the inhibition of fatty acid metabolism."
"The Journal of general virology","Currently, there are no worldwide licensed vaccines for Rift Valley fever (RVF) that are both safe and effective. Development and evaluation of vaccines, diagnostics and treatments depend on the availability of appropriate animal models. Animal models are also necessary to understand the basic pathobiology of infection. Here, we report the use of an inbred MBT/Pas mouse model that consistently reproduces RVF disease and serves our purpose for testing the efficacy of vaccine candidates; an attenuated Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) and a recombinant RVFV-capripoxvirus. We show that this model is relevant for vaccine testing."
"The Journal of general virology","Transcription termination of the mRNA produced from the small (S) genome segment of Bunyamwera orthobunyavirus (BUNV) has previously been mapped to two cis-acting sequences located within the 5' UTR using a virus-free replication assay. The ability of these sequences to terminate transcription was attributed to the shared pentanucleotide motif 3'-UGUCG-5'. Taking advantage of our plasmid-based rescue system to generate recombinant viruses, we re-evaluated the importance of both pentanucleotide motifs as well as that of two other conserved sequences in transcription termination in vivo. Analysis of the 3' ends of positive-stranded viral RNAs derived from the S segment revealed that only the region around the upstream pentanucleotide motif mediated transcription termination in cells infected with wild-type BUNV, leading to mRNAs that were about 100 nt shorter than antigenome RNA. Furthermore, the downstream motif was not recognized in recombinant viruses in which the upstream signal has been disrupted. Our results suggest that in the context of virus infection transcription termination of the BUNV S genome segment mRNA is exclusively directed by the upstream-termination signal. Interestingly, within this region we identified a motif similar to a transcription-termination sequence used by Rift Valley fever phlebovirus."
"Infection, genetics and evolution : journal of molecular epidemiology and evolutionary genetics in infectious diseases","The spatial dynamics of zoonotic arthropod-borne viruses is a fashionable though challenging topic. Inter-human local transmission of a given arbovirus during an outbreak and its spread over large distances are considered as key parameters of emergence. Here, we suggest that insular ecosystems provide ideal natural ""laboratory"" conditions to uncouple local transmission from long distance spread, and differentiate these two processes. Due to geographic isolation, often-limited land surface area and relatively homogenous ecosystems, oceanic islands display low species richness and often-high levels of endemism. These aspects provide the means for comprehensive entomological surveys and investigations of original host/pathogen interactions. In addition, islands are interconnected through discrete anthropogenic and non-anthropogenic exchanges: whilst islands maintain a substantial level of human and domestic animal exchange with other neighbouring or distant territories, they also comprise dispersal and migratory pathways of volant organisms (insects, birds and bats). Hence, both anthropogenic and non-anthropogenic exchanges in island systems are easier to identify and investigate than in continuous, continental systems. Finally, island ecosystems tend to be notably simpler, more prone to invasive taxa and, therefore, easier to document the colonization or displacement of vector species. These different aspects are presented and overlaid upon the spread of arboviruses within two distinct insular systems: islands of Polynesia and the south-western Indian Ocean. The former have been repeatedly affected by Dengue fever epidemics, while the latter recently suffered four successive epidemics, probably of east African origin, three of which involved the emerging viruses Chikungunya, Rift Valley and Dengue fever. Here, we review some new insights into arboviral spread and evolution associated with investigations that followed these epidemics, as well as several aspects that make insular ecosystems favourable to the investigation of arboviral transmission and spread.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

"Journal of wildlife diseases","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a zoonotic arbovirus affecting primarily domestic ruminants and humans. Numerous vector species are known or implicated in the transmission of RVFV. The role of mammals in the maintenance of RVFV, and the existence of a wild mammal reservoir in the epidemiologic cycle of RVFV, remain largely unknown. Our objective is to present a detailed review of studies undertaken on RVFV, often associated with wild mammals, with the aim of focusing future research on potential reservoirs of the virus. Natural and experimental infections related to RVFV in several mammalian orders, including Artiodactyla, Chiroptera, Rodentia, Primata (nonhuman), Perissodactyla, Carnivora, Proboscidea, Erinaceomorpha, and Lagomorpha, are reviewed; the first four orders have received the greatest attention. The possible role of wild ruminants, especially African buffalo (Syncerus caffer), is also discussed. Conflicting results have been published concerning rodents but, based on the literature, the likely candidate species include the African genera Arvicanthis and Micaelamys and the widely introduced roof rat (Rattus rattus). Members of the orders Chiroptera and Rodentia should receive greater attention associated with new research programs. For the other orders mentioned above, few data are available. We are unaware of any investigation concerning the orders Afrosoricida and Soricomorpha, which are represented in the geographic area of RVFV and can be abundant. As a first step to resolve the question of wild mammals as a reservoir of RVFV, serologic and virologic surveys should be promoted during epizootic periods to document infected wild animals and, in the case of positive results, extended to interepidemic periods to explore the role of wild animals as possible reservoirs."
"PloS one","PriMux is a new software package for selecting multiplex compatible, degenerate primers and probes to detect diverse targets such as viruses. It requires no multiple sequence alignment, instead applying k-mer algorithms, hence it scales well for large target sets and saves user effort from curating sequences into alignable groups. PriMux has the capability to predict degenerate primers as well as probes suitable for TaqMan or other primer/probe triplet assay formats, or simply probes for microarray or other single-oligo assay formats. PriMux employs suffix array methods for efficient calculations on oligos 10-~100 nt in length. TaqMan® primers and probes for each segment of Rift Valley fever virus were designed using PriMux, and lab testing comparing signatures designed using PriMux versus those designed using traditional methods demonstrated equivalent or better sensitivity for the PriMux-designed signatures compared to traditional signatures. In addition, we used PriMux to design TaqMan® primers and probes for unalignable or poorly alignable groups of targets: that is, all segments of Rift Valley fever virus analyzed as a single target set of 198 sequences, or all 2863 Dengue virus genomes for all four serotypes available at the time of our analysis.

"PLoS neglected tropical diseases","The Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is an arthropod-borne phlebovirus. RVFV mostly causes outbreaks among domestic ruminants with a major economic impact. Human infections are associated with these events, with a fatality rate of 0.5-2%. Since the virus is able to use many mosquito species of temperate climates as vectors, it has a high potential to spread to outside Africa.We conducted a stratified, cross-sectional sero-prevalence survey in 1228 participants from Mbeya region, southwestern Tanzania. Samples were selected from 17,872 persons who took part in a cohort study in 2007 and 2008. RVFV IgG status was determined by indirect immunofluorescence. Possible risk factors were analyzed using uni- and multi-variable Poisson regression models. We found a unique local maximum of RVFV IgG prevalence of 29.3% in a study site close to Lake Malawi (N = 150). The overall seroprevalence was 5.2%. Seropositivity was significantly associated with higher age, lower socio-economic status, ownership of cattle and decreased with distance to Lake Malawi. A high vegetation density, higher minimum and lower maximum temperatures were found to be associated with RVFV IgG positivity. Altitude of residence, especially on a small scale in the high-prevalence area was strongly correlated (PR 0.87 per meter, 95% CI = 0.80-0.94). Abundant surface water collections are present in the lower areas of the high-prevalence site. RVF has not been diagnosed clinically, nor an outbreak detected in the high-prevalence area.RVFV is probably circulating endemically in the region. The presence of cattle, dense vegetation and temperate conditions favour mosquito propagation and virus replication in the vector and seem to play major roles in virus transmission and circulation. The environmental risk-factors that we identified could serve to more exactly determine areas at risk for RVFV endemicity."
"Current opinion in virology","Rift Valley fever virus is a mosquito-borne pathogen of livestock and humans that causes widespread and devastating outbreaks of severe and often fatal disease throughout Africa and portions of the Arabian Peninsula. Outbreaks can involve tens to hundreds of thousands of human cases, and millions of livestock. The severity of the disease varies by species, but in sheep and cattle 'abortion storms', high neonatal (∼70%), and adult mortality (20-30%) are features. Human cases are generally self-limiting, but severe complications such as hepatitis, retinitis, delayed-onset encephalitis, or a hemorrhagic syndrome with a case fatality of 10-20% can occur. There are no commercially available human vaccines. Livestock provide key ecological links between the Aedes sp. mosquito vector and humans. High viremias in livestock lead to spillover of RVFV into other anthrophillic vectors (Culex and Anopheles sp. mosquitoes), and, importantly, close contact with infected animal tissues and fluids or aborted fetal materials from these animals is a major risk factor for severe and lethal human infections. Vaccination programs targeting livestock during non-epidemic periods or as an early countermeasure against nascent outbreaks could therefore eliminate one of the main sources of human infection and limit the overall scope of epidemics. To this end, research groups have recently reported novel next generation RVFV vaccines that are safe for use in pregnant and young animals. Preventing RVFV infection of livestock by vaccination is a key element in breaking the chain of human epidemics, and could lead to control of this significant public health threat.Published by Elsevier B.V."
"Journal of virological methods","A multiplex bead-based suspension array was developed that can be used for the simultaneous detection of antibodies against the surface glycoprotein Gn and the nucleocapsid protein N of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) in various animal species. The N protein and the purified ectodomain of the Gn protein were covalently linked to paramagnetic Luminex beads. The performance of the resulting multiplex immunoassay was evaluated by testing a comprehensive and well-characterized panel of sera from sheep, cattle and humans. The suitability of this multiplex immunoassay to differentiate infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA) was investigated by testing sera from lambs vaccinated with a paramyxovirus vaccine vector expressing the RVFV surface glycoproteins Gn and Gc. The results suggest that the bead-based suspension array can be used as a DIVA assay to accompany several recently developed experimental vaccines that are based on RVFV glycoproteins, and are devoid of the N protein.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

"Vaccine","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a mosquito-transmitted Bunyavirus that causes high morbidity and mortality among ruminants and humans. The virus is endemic to the African continent and the Arabian Peninsula and continues to spread into new areas. The explosive nature of RVF outbreaks requires that vaccines provide swift protection after a single vaccination. We recently developed several candidate vaccines and here report their efficacy in lambs within three weeks after a single vaccination. The first vaccine comprises the purified ectodomain of the Gn structural glycoprotein formulated in a water-in-oil adjuvant. The second vaccine is based on a Newcastle disease virus-based vector that produces both RVFV structural glycoproteins Gn and Gc. The third vaccine comprises a recently developed nonspreading RVFV. The latter two vaccines were administered without adjuvant. The inactivated whole virus-based vaccine produced by Onderstepoort Biological Products was used as a positive control. Five out of six mock-vaccinated lambs developed high viremia and fever and one lamb succumbed to the challenge infection. A single vaccination with each vaccine resulted in a neutralizing antibody response within three weeks after vaccination and protected lambs from viremia, pyrexia and mortality.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

"PLoS neglected tropical diseases","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a major human and animal pathogen associated with severe disease including hemorrhagic fever or encephalitis. RVFV is endemic to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, but there is significant concern regarding its introduction into non-endemic regions and the potentially devastating effect to livestock populations with concurrent infections of humans. To date, there is little detailed data directly comparing the host response to infection with wild-type or vaccine strains of RVFV and correlation with viral pathogenesis. Here we characterized clinical and systemic immune responses to infection with wild-type strain ZH501 or IND vaccine strain MP-12 in the C57BL/6 mouse. Animals infected with live-attenuated MP-12 survived productive viral infection with little evidence of clinical disease and minimal cytokine response in evaluated tissues. In contrast, ZH501 infection was lethal, caused depletion of lymphocytes and platelets and elicited a strong, systemic cytokine response which correlated with high virus titers and significant tissue pathology. Lymphopenia and platelet depletion were indicators of disease onset with indications of lymphocyte recovery correlating with increases in G-CSF production. RVFV is hepatotropic and in these studies significant clinical and histological data supported these findings; however, significant evidence of a pro-inflammatory response in the liver was not apparent. Rather, viral infection resulted in a chemokine response indicating infiltration of immunoreactive cells, such as neutrophils, which was supported by histological data. In brains of ZH501 infected mice, a significant chemokine and pro-inflammatory cytokine response was evident, but with little pathology indicating meningoencephalitis. These data suggest that RVFV pathogenesis in mice is associated with a loss of liver function due to liver necrosis and hepatitis yet the long-term course of disease for those that might survive the initial hepatitis is neurologic in nature which is supported by observations of human disease and the BALB/c mouse model."
"PLoS neglected tropical diseases","The neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are highly endemic but patchily distributed among the 20 countries and almost 400 million people of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, and disproportionately affect an estimated 65 million people living on less than US$2 per day. Egypt has the largest number of people living in poverty of any MENA nation, while Yemen has the highest prevalence of people living in poverty. These two nations stand out for having suffered the highest rates of many NTDs, including the soil-transmitted nematode infections, filarial infections, schistosomiasis, fascioliasis, leprosy, and trachoma, although they should be recognized for recent measures aimed at NTD control. Leishmaniasis, especially cutaneous leishmaniasis, is endemic in Syria, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Morocco, and elsewhere in the region. Both zoonotic (Leishmania major) and anthroponotic (Leishmania tropica) forms are endemic in MENA in rural arid regions and urban regions, respectively. Other endemic zoonotic NTDs include cystic echinococcosis, fascioliasis, and brucellosis. Dengue is endemic in Saudi Arabia, where Rift Valley fever and Alkhurma hemorrhagic fever have also emerged. Great strides have been made towards elimination of several endemic NTDs, including lymphatic filariasis in Egypt and Yemen; schistosomiasis in Iran, Morocco, and Oman; and trachoma in Morocco, Algeria, Iran, Libya, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, and the United Arab Emirates. A particularly noteworthy achievement is the long battle waged against schistosomiasis in Egypt, where prevalence has been brought down by regular praziquantel treatment. Conflict and human and animal migrations are key social determinants in preventing the control or elimination of NTDs in the MENA, while local political will, strengthened international and intersectoral cooperative efforts for surveillance, mass drug administration, and vaccination are essential for elimination."
"Tropical animal health and production","Serological prevalence of IgG antibodies against Rift Valley fever (RVFV) virus was investigated in 22 major localities in five different regions of Saudi Arabia where vaccination against RVF virus (RVFV) is not practiced. The study excludes the southwestern region where a major outbreak of RVF occurred in 2000 and where annual vaccination of ruminants is practiced. Sheep and goat IgG-sandwich ELISA were used to test serum samples from sheep and goats, and bovine IgG-sandwich ELISA was used to test cattle sera. A nonspecies-specific, nonantibody isotype-specific ELISA was used to test camel sera. A total of 3,480 sheep, goats, cattle and camels with no previous history of vaccination against RVFV were randomly tested. All tested animals were negative for IgG class antibodies against the virus except four out of 1,508 sheep and three out of 913 goats, which tested positive. All animals were clinically normal and no evidence was found of virus activity in the studied areas. It is, therefore, most likely that those rare positive cases, which constituted 0.002% of the total animals tested, were either false positives or vaccinates smuggled from the outbreak zone. The need for regular monitoring of animals both within the outbreak zone of 2000 and other parts of the kingdom is strongly emphasized."
"Journal of virology","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) causes outbreaks of severe disease in people and livestock throughout Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. The potential for RVFV introduction outside the area of endemicity highlights the need for fast-acting, safe, and efficacious vaccines. Here, we demonstrate a robust system for the reverse genetics generation of a RVF virus replicon particle (VRP(RVF)) vaccine candidate. Using a mouse model, we show that VRP(RVF) immunization provides the optimal balance of safety and single-dose robust efficacy. VRP(RVF) can actively synthesize viral RNA and proteins but lacks structural glycoprotein genes, preventing spread within immunized individuals and reducing the risk of vaccine-induced pathogenicity. VRP(RVF) proved to be completely safe following intracranial inoculation of suckling mice, a stringent test of vaccine safety. Single-dose subcutaneous immunization with VRP(RVF), although it is highly attenuated, completely protected mice against a virulent RVFV challenge dose which was 100,000-fold greater than the 50% lethal dose (LD(50)). Robust protection from lethal challenge was observed by 24 h postvaccination, with 100% protection induced in as little as 96 h. We show that a single subcutaneous VRP(RVF) immunization initiated a systemic antiviral state followed by an enhanced adaptive response. These data contrast sharply with the much-reduced survivability and immune responses observed among animals immunized with nonreplicating viral particles, indicating that replication, even if confined to the initially infected cells, contributes substantially to protective efficacy at early and late time points postimmunization. These data demonstrate that replicon vaccines successfully bridge the gap between safety and efficacy and provide insights into the kinetics of antiviral protection from RVFV infection."
"Antiviral therapy","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), a member of the Bunyaviridae family, may cause severe hepatitis, encephalitis and haemorrhagic fever in humans. There are currently no available licensed vaccines or therapies to treat the viral infection in humans. RNA interference (RNAi)-based viral gene silencing offers a promising approach to inhibiting replication of this highly pathogenic virus. The small (S) segment of the RVFV tripartite genome carries the genetic determinates for pathogenicity during infection. This segment encodes the non-structural S (NSs) and essential nucleocapsid (N) genes.To advance RNAi-based inhibition of RVFV replication, we designed several Pol III short hairpin RNA (shRNA) expression cassettes against the NSs and N genes, including a multimerized plasmid vector that included four shRNA expression cassettes.Effective target silencing was demonstrated using full- and partial-length target reporter assays, and confirmed by western blot analysis of exogenous N and NSs expression. Small RNA northern blots showed detectable RNAi guide strand formation from single and multimerized shRNA constructs. Using a cell culture model of RVFV replication, shRNAs targeting the N gene decreased intracellular nucleocapsid protein concentration and viral replication. The shRNAs directed against the NSs gene reduced NSs protein concentrations and alleviated NSs-mediated cytotoxicity, which may be caused by host transcription suppression.These data are the first demonstration that RNAi activators have a potential therapeutic benefit for countering RVFV infection."
"Journal of the American Mosquito Control Association","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) causes outbreaks of severe disease in domestic ungulates as well as humans in Africa. There is a concern that outbreaks of Rift Valley fever may continue and that this virus may spread into regions where it had not previously been detected. Surveillance and rapid detection are critical to the initiation of an effective disease control program. Here we report on the field evaluation in Kenya of the VectorTest RVFV antigen assay, modeled on the VecTest assay for West Nile virus. The dipsticks provided results in <20 min, were easy to use, and did not require a laboratory with containment facilities. Although none of the field-collected mosquitoes were infected with RVFV, the dipstick provided a clear positive result with pools of field-collected mosquitoes spiked with a single positive, irradiated (to inactivate any infectious virus) mosquito. Similarly, the dipstick was able to detect virus from pools of mosquitoes captured during the RVFV outbreak in 2007. The RVFV dipstick assay was highly specific with only a single weak false positive out of 266 pools tested (specificity > 99.6%). The RVFV assay can provide a rapid, safe, easy-to-use preliminary test to alert public health personnel to the presence of RVFV in mosquitoes in a given area. Results from this assay will allow for more rapid medical threat assessments and the focusing of vector control measures on high-risk areas."
"Journal of the American Mosquito Control Association","The rapid spread of West Nile viral activity across North America since its discovery in 1999 illustrates the potential for an exotic arbovirus to be introduced and become widely established across North America. Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) has been responsible for large outbreaks in Africa that have resulted in hundreds of thousands of human infections and major economic disruption due to loss of livestock and to trade restrictions. However, little is known about the potential for mosquitoes in Canada to transmit this virus, should it be introduced into North America. Therefore, we evaluated mosquito species captured near Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, for their ability to serve as potential vectors for RVFV. Mosquitoes were exposed to RVFV by allowing them to feed on adult hamsters inoculated the previous day with RVFV. These mosquitoes were tested for infection, dissemination, and the ability to transmit RVFV after incubation at 25 degrees C for 14-18 days. Based on the detection of virus in saliva collected in capillary tubes, individual Culex tarsalis, Aedes sticticus, and Coquillettidia perturbans were able to transmit RVFV under laboratory conditions. These preliminary results suggest that these 3 species may be able to transmit RVFV, should this virus be introduced into Canada."
"The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene","We estimated Rift Valley fever (RVF) incidence as a function of geological, geographical, and climatological factors during the 2006-2007 RVF epidemic in Kenya. Location information was obtained for 214 of 340 (63%) confirmed and probable RVF cases that occurred during an outbreak from November 1, 2006 to February 28, 2007. Locations with subtypes of solonetz, calcisols, solonchaks, and planosols soil types were highly associated with RVF occurrence during the outbreak period. Increased rainfall and higher greenness measures before the outbreak were associated with increased risk. RVF was more likely to occur on plains, in densely bushed areas, at lower elevations, and in the Somalia acacia ecological zone. Cases occurred in three spatial temporal clusters that differed by the date of associated rainfall, soil type, and land usage."
"PLoS neglected tropical diseases","Recent clusters of outbreaks of mosquito-borne diseases (Rift Valley fever and chikungunya) in Africa and parts of the Indian Ocean islands illustrate how interannual climate variability influences the changing risk patterns of disease outbreaks. Although Rift Valley fever outbreaks have been known to follow periods of above-normal rainfall, the timing of the outbreak events has largely been unknown. Similarly, there is inadequate knowledge on climate drivers of chikungunya outbreaks. We analyze a variety of climate and satellite-derived vegetation measurements to explain the coupling between patterns of climate variability and disease outbreaks of Rift Valley fever and chikungunya.We derived a teleconnections map by correlating long-term monthly global precipitation data with the NINO3.4 sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly index. This map identifies regional hot-spots where rainfall variability may have an influence on the ecology of vector borne disease. Among the regions are Eastern and Southern Africa where outbreaks of chikungunya and Rift Valley fever occurred 2004-2009. Chikungunya and Rift Valley fever case locations were mapped to corresponding climate data anomalies to understand associations between specific anomaly patterns in ecological and climate variables and disease outbreak patterns through space and time. From these maps we explored associations among Rift Valley fever disease occurrence locations and cumulative rainfall and vegetation index anomalies. We illustrated the time lag between the driving climate conditions and the timing of the first case of Rift Valley fever. Results showed that reported outbreaks of Rift Valley fever occurred after ∼3-4 months of sustained above-normal rainfall and associated green-up in vegetation, conditions ideal for Rift Valley fever mosquito vectors. For chikungunya we explored associations among surface air temperature, precipitation anomalies, and chikungunya outbreak locations. We found that chikungunya outbreaks occurred under conditions of anomalously high temperatures and drought over Eastern Africa. However, in Southeast Asia, chikungunya outbreaks were negatively correlated (p<0.05) with drought conditions, but positively correlated with warmer-than-normal temperatures and rainfall.Extremes in climate conditions forced by the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) lead to severe droughts or floods, ideal ecological conditions for disease vectors to emerge, and may result in epizootics and epidemics of Rift Valley fever and chikungunya. However, the immune status of livestock (Rift Valley fever) and human (chikungunya) populations is a factor that is largely unknown but very likely plays a role in the spatial-temporal patterns of these disease outbreaks. As the frequency and severity of extremes in climate increase, the potential for globalization of vectors and disease is likely to accelerate. Understanding the underlying patterns of global and regional climate variability and their impacts on ecological drivers of vector-borne diseases is critical in long-range planning of appropriate disease and disease-vector response, control, and mitigation strategies."
"Nucleic acids research","Nuclear architecture as well as gene nuclear positioning can modulate gene expression. In this work, we have analyzed the nuclear position of the interferon-β (IFN-β) locus, responsible for the establishment of the innate antiviral response, with respect to pericentromeric heterochromatin (PCH) in correlation with virus-induced IFN-β gene expression. Experiments were carried out in two different cell types either non-infected (NI) or during the time course of three different viral infections. In NI cells, we showed a monoallelic IFN-β promoter association with PCH that strongly decreased after viral infection. Dissociation of the IFN-β locus away from these repressive regions preceded strong promoter transcriptional activation and was reversible within 12  h after infection. No dissociation was observed after infection with a virus that abnormally maintained the IFN-β gene in a repressed state. Dissociation induced after virus infection specifically targeted the IFN-β locus without affecting the general structure and nuclear distribution of PCH clusters. Using cell lines stably transfected with wild-type or mutated IFN-β promoters, we identified the proximal region of the IFN-β promoter containing YY1 DNA-binding sites as the region regulating IFN-β promoter association with PCH before as well as during virus infection."
"Journal of virology","We characterized the RNA elements involved in the packaging of Rift Valley fever virus RNA genome segments, L, M, and S. The 5'-terminal 25 nucleotides of each RNA segment were equally competent for RNA packaging and carried an RNA packaging signal, which overlapped with the RNA replication signal. Only the deletion mutants of L RNA, but not full-length L RNA, were efficiently packaged, implying the possible requirement of RNA compaction for L RNA packaging."
"Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids","A magnetic capture-based, surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) assay for DNA detection has been developed which utilizes Au-coated paramagnetic nanoparticles (Au@PMPs) as both a SERS substrate and effective bioseparation reagent for the selective removal of target DNAs from solution. Hybridization reactions contained two target DNAs, sequence complementary reporter probes conjugated with spectrally distinct Raman dyes distinct for each target, and Au@PMPs conjugated with sequence complementary capture probes. In this case, target DNAs were derived from the RNA genomes of the Rift Valley Fever virus (RVFV) or West Nile virus (WNV). The hybridization reactions were incubated for a short period and then concentrated within the focus beam of an interrogating laser by magnetic pull-down. The attendant SERS response of each individually captured DNA provided a limit of detection sensitivity in the range 20-100 nM. X-ray diffraction and UV-vis analysis validated both the desired surface plasmon resonance properties and bimetallic composition of synthesized Au@PMPs, and UV-vis spectroscopy confirmed conjugation of the Raman dye compounds malachite green (MG) and erythrosin B (EB) with the RVFV and WNV reporter probes, respectively. Finally, hybridization reactions assembled for multiplexed detection of both targets yielded mixed MG/EB spectra and clearly differentiated peaks which facilitate the quantitative detection of each DNA target. On the basis of the simple design of a single-particle DNA detection assay, the opportunity is provided to develop magnetic capture-based SERS assays that are easily assembled and adapted for high-level multiplex detection using low-cost Raman instrumentation.© 2012 American Chemical Society"
"Antiviral research","Nucleocapsid protein (N) is an essential RNA binding protein in many RNA viruses. During replication, N protein encapsidates viral genomic and antigenomic RNA, but not viral mRNA or other cellular RNAs. To discriminate between different species of RNA in a host cell, it is likely that N interacts with specific sequences and/or secondary structures on its target RNA. In this study, we explore the RNA binding properties of N using both natural and artificially selected RNAs as ligands. We found that N binds to RNAs that resemble the terminal panhandle structures of RVFV genomic and antigenomic RNA. Furthermore, we used SELEX to isolate RNA aptamers that bound N with high affinity and determined that N specifically recognizes and binds to GAUU and pyrimidine/guanine motifs. Interestingly, BLAST analysis revealed the presence of these motifs within the coding region of the viral genome, suggesting that N may interact with non-terminal viral RNA sequences during replication. Finally, the aptamer RNAs were used to construct a sensitive fluorescence based sensor of N binding with potential applications for drug screening and imaging methodologies.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

"Journal of virological methods","Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) raised against the nucleoprotein (NP) of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) were developed, and an antigen-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Ag-capture ELISA) system was developed for the detection of RVFV NP. The assay detected RVFV antigen from culture supernatants containing as little as 7.8-31.3 pfu per 100 μl. Reactivity with various truncated NPs indicated that MAb C10-54 bound only to the full-length NP, probably due to recognition of a conformational epitope, whereas MAbs G2-36 and D5-59 bound to a linear epitope ranging from amino acid residues 195-201 in the C-terminal region. Based on the alignments of the amino acid sequence of RVFV NP, the epitope regions of MAbs G2-36 and D5-59 were completely conserved among all RVFV strains. These results suggest that the MAbs are applicable to the Ag-capture ELISA for the diagnosis of RVFV infections.Copyright Â© 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"The Journal of biological chemistry","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a highly pathogenic arthropod-borne virus infecting a wide range of vertebrate hosts. Of particular interest is the nonstructural NSs protein, which forms large filamentous fibril bundles in the nucleus. Past studies have shown NSs to be a multifaceted protein important for virulence through modulation of the interferon response as well acting as a general inhibitor of transcription. Here we investigated the regulation of the DNA damage signaling cascades by RVFV infection and found virally inducted phosphorylation of the classical DNA damage signaling proteins, ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) (Ser-1981), Chk.2 (Thr-68), H2A.X (Ser-139), and p53 (Ser-15). In contrast, ataxia-telangiectasia mutated and Rad3-related kinase (ATR) (Ser-428) phosphorylation was decreased following RVFV infection. Importantly, both the attenuated vaccine strain MP12 and the fully virulent strain ZH548 showed strong parallels in their up-regulation of the ATM arm of the DNA damage response and in the down-regulation of the ATR pathway. The increase in DNA damage signaling proteins did not result from gross DNA damage as no increase in DNA damage was observed following infection. Rather the DNA damage signaling was found to be dependent on the viral protein NSs, as an NSs mutant virus was not found to induce the equivalent signaling pathways. RVFV MP12-infected cells also displayed an S phase arrest that was found to be dependent on NSs expression. Use of ATM and Chk.2 inhibitors resulted in a marked decrease in S phase arrest as well as viral production. These results indicate that RVFV NSs induces DNA damage signaling pathways that are beneficial for viral replication."
"PLoS neglected tropical diseases","Rift Valley fever is an acute, zoonotic viral disease of domestic ruminants, caused by a phlebovirus (Bunyaviridae family). A large outbreak occurred in Madagascar in 2008-2009. The goal of the present study was to evaluate the point prevalence of antibodies against Rift Valley Fever Virus (RVFV) in cattle in the Anjozorobe district, located in the wet and temperate highland region of Madagascar and yet heavily affected by the disease, and analyse environmental and trade factors potentially linked to RVFV transmission. A serological study was performed in 2009 in 894 bovines. For each bovine, the following variables were recorded: age, location of the night pen, minimum distance from the pen to the nearest water point and the forest, nearest water point type, and herd replacement practices. The serological data were analyzed using a generalized linear mixed model. The overall anti-RVFV IgG seroprevalence rate was 28% [CI95% 25-31]. Age was statistically linked to prevalence (p = 10(-4)), being consistent with a recurrent RVFV circulation. Distance from the night pen to the nearest water point was a protective factor (p = 5.10(-3)), which would be compatible with a substantial part of the virus transmission being carried out by nocturnal mosquito vectors. However, water point type did not influence the risk of infection: several mosquito species are probably involved. Cattle belonging to owners who purchase animals to renew the herd were significantly more likely to have seroconverted than others (p = 0.04): cattle trade may contribute to the introduction of the virus in this area. The minimum distance of the night pen to the forest was not linked to the prevalence. This is the first evidence of a recurrent transmission of RVFV in such an ecosystem that associates a wet, temperate climate, high altitude, paddy fields, and vicinity to a dense rain forest. Persistence mechanisms need to be further investigated."
"Journal of virological methods","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a zoonotic insect transmitted virus endemic to Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. Infection causes abortions and high mortality in newborn ruminants. The overall human infection rate is <1%; however, fatality rates in those with severe clinical disease have been reported as high as 29%. The potential of RVFV as a bioterrorism agent and/or being accidentally introduced into North America is widely recognized. Currently, regional veterinary biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) diagnostic laboratories lack safe, modern, validated diagnostic tests to detect RVFV. An existing one-step real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) assay was modified for quick virus inactivation for use in BSL-2 laboratories, evaluated on serum and tissue samples from experimentally infected lambs and calves, and compared to virus isolation. Viremia was detected in all inoculated sheep with titers reaching 10(6.5) plaque forming units/ml, or up to 10(10) viral RNA copies/ml. Viremia in calves was lower and not detected in all inoculated animals; however, all animals became transiently febrile and were infected as determined by rRT-PCR of tissues. Virus was isolated from rRT-PCR-positive liver and/or spleen in 33% of lamb and 41% of calf samples between 2 and 7 days post inoculation. For RVFV antigen detection, reagents are typically produced at BSL-3Ag or BSL-4 conditions and require inactivation and safety testing for use outside of containment. In this study, antiserum against recombinant RVFV-nucleocapsid (N) was produced to develop an immunohistochemical (IHC) assay which was subsequently evaluated on formalin fixed lamb and calf tissues at BSL-2 laboratory conditions. Antigen was detected by IHC in 79% of rRT-PCR-positive sheep and 70% of rRT-PCR-positive calf tissues tested. Once validated and approved by national regulatory agencies, these assays can be safely produced and distributed to regional diagnostic laboratories, providing capacity for early detection of RVFV in suspected ruminant samples.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

"PLoS neglected tropical diseases","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) causes disease in livestock and humans. It can be transmitted by mosquitoes, inhalation or physical contact with the body fluids of infected animals. Severe clinical cases are characterized by acute hepatitis with hemorrhage, meningoencephalitis and/or retinitis. The dynamics of RVFV infection and the cell types infected in vivo are poorly understood.RVFV strains expressing humanized Renilla luciferase (hRLuc) or green fluorescent protein (GFP) were generated and inoculated to susceptible Ifnar1-deficient mice. We investigated the tissue tropism in these mice and the nature of the target cells in vivo using whole-organ imaging and flow cytometry. After intraperitoneal inoculation, hRLuc signal was observed primarily in the thymus, spleen and liver. Macrophages infiltrating various tissues, in particular the adipose tissue surrounding the pancreas also expressed the virus. The liver rapidly turned into the major luminescent organ and the mice succumbed to severe hepatitis. The brain remained weakly luminescent throughout infection. FACS analysis in RVFV-GFP-infected mice showed that the macrophages, dendritic cells and granulocytes were main target cells for RVFV. The crucial role of cells of the monocyte/macrophage/dendritic lineage during RVFV infection was confirmed by the slower viral dissemination, decrease in RVFV titers in blood, and prolonged survival of macrophage- and dendritic cell-depleted mice following treatment with clodronate liposomes. Upon dermal and nasal inoculations, the viral dissemination was primarily observed in the lymph node draining the injected ear and in the lungs respectively, with a significant increase in survival time.These findings reveal the high levels of phagocytic cells harboring RVFV during viral infection in Ifnar1-deficient mice. They demonstrate that bioluminescent and fluorescent viruses can shed new light into the pathogenesis of RVFV infection."
"Journal of virology","Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus (RVFV) can cause severe human disease characterized by either acute-onset hepatitis, delayed-onset encephalitis, retinitis and blindness, or a hemorrhagic syndrome. The existing nonhuman primate (NHP) model for RVF utilizes an intravenous (i.v.) exposure route in rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). Severe disease in these animals is infrequent, and large cohorts are needed to observe significant morbidity and mortality. To overcome these drawbacks, we evaluated the infectivity and pathogenicity of RVFV in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) by i.v., subcutaneous (s.c.), and intranasal exposure routes to more closely mimic natural exposure. Marmosets were more susceptible to RVFV than rhesus macaques and experienced higher rates of morbidity, mortality, and viremia and marked aberrations in hematological and chemistry values. An overwhelming infection of hepatocytes was a major consequence of infection of marmosets by the i.v. and s.c. exposure routes. Additionally, these animals displayed signs of hemorrhagic manifestations and neurological impairment. Based on our results, the common marmoset model more closely resembles severe human RVF disease and is therefore an ideal model for the evaluation of potential vaccines and therapeutics."
"Virology journal","Rift Valley Fever virus (RVFV, genus: Phlebovirus, family: Bunyaviridae), is an arbovirus which causes significant morbidity and mortality in animals and humans. RVFV was introduced for the first time in Egypt in 1977. In endemic areas, the insect vector control and vaccination is considering appropriate measures if applied properly and the used vaccine is completely safe and the vaccination programs cover all the susceptible animals. Egypt is importing livestock and camels from the African Horn & the Sudan for human consumption. The imported livestock and camels were usually not vaccinated against RVFV. But in rare occasions, the imported livestock were vaccinated but with unknown date of vaccination and the unvaccinated control contacts were unavailable for laboratory investigations. Also, large number of the imported livestock and camels are often escaped slaughtering for breeding which led to the spread of new strains of FMD and the introduction of RVFV from the enzootic African countries. This article provide general picture about the present situation of RVFV in Egypt to help in controlling this important disease."
"Journal of vector ecology : journal of the Society for Vector Ecology","The temporal distribution and spatial pattern of abundance of mosquito vectors of Rift Valley fever (RVf) and West Nile fever (WNf) were studied during the 2005 and 2006 rainy seasons at Barkedji, Senegal. Mosquitoes were collected every two weeks with CDC light traps with dry ice at 79 sites including temporary ponds, barren, shrubby savannah, wooded savannah, steppes, and villages at different distances (between 0 and 600 m) from the nearest pond. The temporal distributions of these vectors varied between 2005 and 2006 and were positively correlated with rainfall for Aedes (Aedimorphus) vexans Patton, with rainfall after a lag time of one month for Culex (Culex) poicilipes (Theobald) and Culex (Culex) neavei Theobald. All the vectors had their highest abundances and parity rates between September and November. The highest vector abundances were observed in the barren and temporary ponds. The distance of trap location to the nearest ponds was negatively correlated to the abundance of the vectors. Taking into account the linear regression equations, it was predicted that mosquitoes would not disperse and be collected by the light trap, up to 1,500 m to the nearest ponds. The implications of these findings in the epidemiology and control of RVF and WNF at Barkedji are discussed.© 2011 The Society for Vector Ecology."
"Zoonoses and public health","The Armed Forces Health Surveillance Center (AFHSC), Division of Global Emerging Infections Surveillance and Response System conducts disease surveillance through a global network of US Department of Defense research laboratories and partnerships with foreign ministries of agriculture, health and livestock development in over 90 countries worldwide. In 2010, AFHSC supported zoonosis survey efforts were organized into four main categories: (i) development of field assays for animal disease surveillance during deployments and in resource limited environments, (ii) determining zoonotic disease prevalence in high-contact species which may serve as important reservoirs of diseases and sources of transmission, (iii) surveillance in high-risk human populations which are more likely to become exposed and subsequently infected with zoonotic pathogens and (iv) surveillance at the human-animal interface examining zoonotic disease prevalence and transmission within and between human and animal populations. These efforts have aided in the detection, identification and quantification of the burden of zoonotic diseases such as anthrax, brucellosis, Crimean Congo haemorrhagic fever, dengue fever, Hantaan virus, influenza, Lassa fever, leptospirosis, melioidosis, Q fever, Rift Valley fever, sandfly fever Sicilian virus, sandfly fever Naples virus, tuberculosis and West Nile virus, which are of military and public health importance.

"Virus research","Emerging and naturally occurring infectious diseases from bacterial and viral sources are constantly threatening humans and livestock. Recently, a variety of infectious diseases have emerged into previously disease-free areas, resulting in new epidemics. Consequently, governmental agencies and researchers in the area of biomedical research have started designing ways to prevent their further spread. Ongoing research activities are focused on developing therapeutic and prophylactic interventions against these emerging infections. Development and evaluation of vaccines, diagnostics and treatments often depend on the development of appropriate animal models to determine the efficacy of new therapeutic agents. In addition, animal models are necessary to understand the basic pathobiology of infection.

"Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), which causes hemorrhagic fever, neurological disorders or blindness in humans, and a high rate abortion and fetal malformation in ruminants, has been classified as a HHS/USDA overlap select agent and a risk group 3 pathogen. It belongs to the genus Phlebovirus in the family Bunyaviridae and is one of the most virulent members of this family. Several reverse genetics systems for the RVFV MP-12 vaccine strain as well as wild-type RVFV strains, including ZH548 and ZH501, have been developed since 2006. The MP-12 strain (which is a risk group 2 pathogen and a non-select agent) is highly attenuated by several mutations in its M- and L-segments, but still carries virulent S-segment RNA, which encodes a functional virulence factor, NSs. The rMP12-C13type (C13type) carrying 69% in-frame deletion of NSs ORF lacks all the known NSs functions, while it replicates as efficient as does MP-12 in VeroE6 cells lacking type-I IFN. NSs induces a shut-off of host transcription including interferon (IFN)-beta mRNA and promotes degradation of double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) at the post-translational level. IFN-beta is transcriptionally upregulated by interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3), NF-kB and activator protein-1 (AP-1), and the binding of IFN-beta to IFN-alpha/beta receptor (IFNAR) stimulates the transcription of IFN-alpha genes or other interferon stimulated genes (ISGs), which induces host antiviral activities, whereas host transcription suppression including IFN-beta gene by NSs prevents the gene upregulations of those ISGs in response to viral replication although IRF-3, NF-kB and activator protein-1 (AP-1) can be activated by RVFV7. Thus, NSs is an excellent target to further attenuate MP-12, and to enhance host innate immune responses by abolishing the IFN-beta suppression function. Here, we describe a protocol for generating a recombinant MP-12 encoding mutated NSs, and provide an example of a screening method to identify NSs mutants lacking the function to suppress IFN-beta mRNA synthesis. In addition to its essential role in innate immunity, type-I IFN is important for the maturation of dendritic cells and the induction of an adaptive immune response. Thus, NSs mutants inducing type-I IFN are further attenuated, but at the same time are more efficient at stimulating host immune responses than wild-type MP-12, which makes them ideal candidates for vaccination approaches."
"Clinical and vaccine immunology : CVI","Rift Valley fever (RVF) is an emerging zoonosis in Africa which has spread to Egypt, the Arabian Peninsula, Madagascar, and Comoros. RVF virus (RVFV) (Bunyaviridae family, Phlebovirus genus) causes a wide range of symptoms in humans, from benign fever to fatal hemorrhagic fever. Ruminants are severely affected by the disease, which leads to a high rate of mortality in young animals and to abortions and teratogenesis in pregnant females. Diagnostic tests include virus isolation and genome or antibody detection. During RVFV infection, the nucleoprotein encapsidating the tripartite RNA genome is expressed in large amounts and raises a robust antibody response, while the envelope glycoproteins elicit neutralizing antibodies which play a major role in protection. Much less is known about the antigenicity/immunogenicity of the nonstructural protein NSs, which is a major virulence factor. Here we have developed a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) enabling detection of low levels of NSs-specific antibodies in naturally infected or vaccinated ruminants. Detection of the NSs antibodies was validated by Western blotting. Altogether, our data showed that the NSs antibodies were detected in only 55% of animals naturally infected by RVFV, indicating that NSs does not induce a consistently high immune response. These results are discussed in light of differentiation between infected and vaccinated animals (DIVA) tests distinguishing naturally infected animals and those vaccinated with NSs-defective vaccines."
"Antiviral research","The highly lethal filoviruses, Ebola and Marburg cause severe hemorrhagic fever in humans and non-human primates. To date there are no licensed vaccines or therapeutics to counter these infections. Identifying novel pathways and host targets that play an essential role during infection will provide potential targets to develop therapeutics. Small molecule chemical screening for Ebola virus inhibitors resulted in identification of a compound NSC 62914. The compound was found to exhibit anti-filovirus activity in cell-based assays and in vivo protected mice following challenge with Ebola or Marburg viruses. Additionally, the compound was found to inhibit Rift Valley fever virus, Lassa virus and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus in cell-based assays. Investigation of the mechanism of action of the compound revealed that it had antioxidant properties. Specifically, compound NSC 62914 was found to act as a scavenger of reactive oxygen species, and to up-regulate oxidative stress-induced genes. However, four known antioxidant compounds failed to inhibit filovirus infection, thus suggesting that the mechanistic basis of the antiviral function of the antioxidant NSC 62914 may involve modulation of multiple signaling pathways/targets.Published by Elsevier B.V."
"The Journal of veterinary medical science / the Japanese Society of Veterinary Science","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is one of the important emerging viral diseases of serious impact in public health and animal hygiene both in human and animal industries.

The recombinant N protein of RVFV was expressed in E. coli with a six-histidine tag, and the purified N protein was used for detecting antigen with a competitive monoclonal antibody against RVFV antibodies. The competitive ELISA (C-ELISA) could detect antibodies at 9-11 days after inoculation in goats and cattle with a sensitivity of 94.7% (virus neutralization titer >32) and specificity of 99.7%, respectively. In addition, the C-ELISA did not show any cross-reactivity with positive sera against arboviruses such as Akabane, Aino, Chuzan, Ibaraki and bovine ephemeral fever virus, which are prevalent viral agents in ruminant animals throughout Southeast Asia. The results of the present study indicate that the C-ELISA is a simple, rapid and convenient serodiagnostic method for RVFV in goats and cattle."
"Virology","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) causes significant morbidity and mortality in humans and livestock throughout Africa and the Middle East. The clinical disease ranges from mild febrile illness, to hepatitis, retinitis, encephalitis and fatal hemorrhagic fever. RVFV NSs protein has previously been shown to interfere in vitro with the interferon response, and RVFV lacking the NSs protein is attenuated in several animal models. Monocytes and macrophages are key players in the innate immune response via expression of various cytokines and chemokines. Here we demonstrate that wild-type RVFV infection of human monocyte-derived macrophages leads to a productive infection and inhibition of the innate immune response via decreased expression of IFN-α2, IFN-β and TNF-α. Using a recombinant virus lacking the NSs protein, we show that this effect is mediated by the viral NSs protein. Finally, analysis of RVF patient samples demonstrated an association between a pro-inflammatory cytokine response and patient survival.Published by Elsevier Inc."
"Emerging infectious diseases","During September-October 2010, an unprecedented outbreak of Rift Valley fever was reported in the northern Sahelian region of Mauritania after exceptionally heavy rainfall.

"Viruses","The continuing use of high-throughput assays to investigate cellular responses to infection is providing a large repository of information. Due to the large number of differentially expressed transcripts, often running into the thousands, the majority of these data have not been thoroughly investigated. Advances in techniques for the downstream analysis of high-throughput datasets are providing additional methods for the generation of additional hypotheses for further investigation. The large number of experimental observations, combined with databases that correlate particular genes and proteins with canonical pathways, functions and diseases, allows for the bioinformatic exploration of functional networks that may be implicated in replication or pathogenesis. Herein, we provide an example of how analysis of published high-throughput datasets of cellular responses to hemorrhagic fever virus infection can generate additional functional data. We describe enrichment of genes involved in metabolism, post-translational modification and cardiac damage; potential roles for specific transcription factors and a conserved involvement of a pathway based around cyclooxygenase-2. We believe that these types of analyses can provide virologists with additional hypotheses for continued investigation."
"PLoS neglected tropical diseases","Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a neglected, emerging, mosquito-borne disease with severe negative impact on human and animal health and economy. RVF is caused by RVF virus (RVFV) affecting humans and a wide range of animals. The virus is transmitted through bites from mosquitoes and exposure to viremic blood, body fluids, or tissues of infected animals. During 2007 a large RVF outbreak occurred in Sudan with a total of 747 confirmed human cases including 230 deaths (case fatality 30.8%); although it has been estimated 75,000 were infected. It was most severe in White Nile, El Gezira, and Sennar states near to the White Nile and the Blue Nile Rivers. Notably, RVF was not demonstrated in livestock until after the human cases appeared and unfortunately, there are no records or reports of the number of affected animals or deaths. Ideally, animals should serve as sentinels to prevent loss of human life, but the situation here was reversed. Animal contact seemed to be the most dominant risk factor followed by animal products and mosquito bites. The Sudan outbreak followed an unusually heavy rainfall in the country with severe flooding and previous studies on RVF in Sudan suggest that RVFV is endemic in parts of Sudan. An RVF outbreak results in human disease, but also large economic loss with an impact beyond the immediate influence on the directly affected agricultural producers. The outbreak emphasizes the need for collaboration between veterinary and health authorities, entomologists, environmental specialists, and biologists, as the best strategy towards the prevention and control of RVF."
"Journal of virology","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a mosquito-borne human and veterinary pathogen causing large outbreaks of severe disease throughout Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. Safe and effective vaccines are critically needed, especially those that can be used in a targeted one-health approach to prevent both livestock and human disease. We report here on the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of the ΔNSs-ΔNSm recombinant RVFV (rRVFV) vaccine (which lacks the NSs and NSm virulence factors) in a total of 41 sheep, including 29 timed-pregnant ewes. This vaccine was proven safe and immunogenic for adult animals at doses ranging from 1.0 × 10(3) to 1.0 × 10(5) PFU administered subcutaneously (s.c.). Pregnant animals were vaccinated with 1.0 × 10(4) PFU s.c. at day 42 of gestation, when fetal sensitivity to RVFV vaccine-induced teratogenesis is highest. No febrile reactions, clinical illness, or pregnancy loss was observed following vaccination. Vaccination resulted in a rapid increase in anti-RVFV IgM (day 4) and IgG (day 7) titers. No seroconversion occurred in cohoused control animals. A subset of 20 ewes progressed to full-term delivery after vaccination. All lambs were born without musculoskeletal, neurological, or histological birth defects. Vaccine efficacy was assessed in 9 pregnant animals challenged at day 122 of gestation with virulent RVFV (1.0 × 10(6) PFU intravenously). Following challenge, 100% (9/9) of the animals were protected, progressed to full term, and delivered healthy lambs. As expected, all 3 sham-vaccinated controls experienced viremia, fetal death, and abortion postchallenge. These results demonstrate that the ΔNSs-ΔNSm rRVFV vaccine is safe and nonteratogenic and confers high-level protection in sheep."

This finding demonstrated the utility of next generation sequencing and a metagenomic approach to identify an etiological agent and direct the response to a disease outbreak.Copyright © 2011.

"Journal of virology","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a mosquito-borne zoonotic bunyavirus of the genus Phlebovirus and a serious human and veterinary pathogen. RVFV contains a three-segmented RNA genome, which is comprised of the large (L), medium (M), and small (S) segments. The proteins that are essential for genome replication are encoded by the L and S segments, whereas the structural glycoproteins are encoded by the M segment. We have produced BHK replicon cell lines (BHK-Rep) that maintain replicating L and S genome segments. Transfection of BHK-Rep cells with a plasmid encoding the structural glycoproteins results in the efficient production of RVFV replicon particles (RRPs). To facilitate monitoring of infection, the NSs gene was replaced with an enhanced green fluorescent protein gene. RRPs are infectious for both mammalian and insect cells but are incapable of autonomous spreading, rendering their application outside biosafety containment completely safe. We demonstrate that a single intramuscular vaccination with RRPs protects mice from a lethal dose of RVFV and show that RRPs can be used for rapid virus neutralization tests that do not require biocontainment facilities. The methods reported here will greatly facilitate vaccine and drug development as well as fundamental studies on RVFV biology. Moreover, it may be possible to develop similar systems for other members of the bunyavirus family as well."
"PloS one","The known virulence factor of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), the NSs protein, counteracts the antiviral effects of the type I interferon response. In this study we evaluated the expression of several genes in the liver and spleen involved in innate and adaptive immunity of mice immunized with a RVFV recombinant nucleocapsid protein (recNP) combined with Alhydrogel adjuvant and control animals after challenge with wild type RVFV. Mice immunized with recNP elicited an earlier IFNβ response after challenge compared to non-immunized controls. In the acute phase of liver infection in non-immunized mice there was a massive upregulation of type I and II interferon, accompanied by high viral titers, and the up- and downregulation of several genes involved in the activation of B- and T-cells, indicating that both humoral and cellular immunity is modulated during RVFV infection. Various genes involved in pro-inflammatory responses and with pro-apoptotic effects were strongly upregulated and anti-apoptotic genes were downregulated in liver of non-immunized mice. Expression of many genes involved in B- and T-cell immunity were downregulated in spleen of non-immunized mice but normal in immunized mice. A strong bias towards apoptosis and inflammation in non-immunized mice at an acute stage of liver infection associated with suppression of several genes involved in activation of humoral and cellular immunity in spleen, suggests that RVFV evades the host immune response in more ways than only by inhibition of type I interferon, and that immunopathology of the liver plays a crucial role in RVF disease progression."
"Journal of virological methods","Haemorrhagic fever viruses cause emerging infections worldwide, and blood or serum is the main sample used for diagnosis. However, storage and transportation of such samples from remote areas to regional laboratories may be complicated and expensive. In this study, a novel approach was evaluated for the detection of Puumala hantavirus (PUUV) RNA and Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) RNA. Whole-blood samples spiked with viable virus particles were tested in parallel with clinical samples from patients with acute haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (nephropathia epidemica). Individual blood samples were spotted on filter paper, dried, and used for RNA extraction at later time points. PUUV RNA was detected by RT-PCR after storage at room temperature for up to six weeks. In contrast, only low copy numbers of RVFV RNA were detected after 1-2 days even though viable RVFV was eluted from the dried filter papers after the same time. The use of filter paper to collect and store blood samples for PUUV RNA detection is therefore a simple and reliable procedure. This approach might facilitate sampling and analysis of other RNA viruses from human or animal sources and could be used for field studies in remote areas or in developing countries.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

"Vector borne and zoonotic diseases (Larchmont, N.Y.)","In August-September 2000, an overwhelming outbreak of Rift Valley fever (RVF) struck the southwestern part of Saudi Arabia and adjoining Yemeni territories. During the outbreak, which was the first ever to be recorded outside Africa, around 40,000 animals, mostly sheep and goats, died or aborted and 883 cases, with 124 deaths, were recorded among humans in Saudi Arabia. An additional 1328 human cases, with 166 deaths, were concurrently recorded in northwestern Yemen. Vector studies in Saudi Arabia established Aedes vexans arabiensis and Culex (culex) triteniorynchus as the biological vectors of RVF virus in the region. Both of these species and several others, which could be potential vectors of the virus, occur throughout the Kingdom. Rigorous control measures were implemented, which succeeded in curtailing the infection and preventing its spread to other parts of the country. However, the virus persisted in a cryptic form in the original area of the epizootic, resulting in intermittent diagnosis of few cases throughout the past 10 years. To date, however, no evidence was found of virus activity outside that area. This review provides, from a veterinary perspective, a brief account of the events surrounding the epizootic and its present status in Saudi Arabia and emphasizes the need for vigilance, preparedness, and regular monitoring of the disease by serosurveillance methods."
"Journal of virology","Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a mosquito-borne zoonotic disease caused by a phlebovirus of the family Bunyaviridae, which affects humans and ruminants in Africa and the Middle East. RFV virus (RVFV) possesses a single-stranded tripartite RNA genome of negative/ambisense polarity. The S segment utilizes the ambisense strategy and codes for two proteins, the N nucleoprotein and the nonstructural NSs protein, in opposite orientations. The two open reading frames (ORFs) are separated by an intergenic region (IGR) highly conserved among strains and containing a motif, 5'-GCUGC-3', present on the genome and antigenome, which was shown previously to play a role in transcription termination (C. G. Albarino, B. H. Bird, and S. T. Nichol, J. Virol. 81:5246-5256, 2007; T. Ikegami, S. Won, C. J. Peters, and S. Makino, J. Virol. 81:8421-8438, 2007). Here, we created recombinant RVFVs with mutations or deletions in the IGR and showed that the substitution of the motif sequence by a series of five A's inactivated transcription termination at the wild-type site but allowed the transcriptase to recognize another site with the consensus sequence present in the opposite ORF. Similar situations were observed for mutants in which the motif was still present in the IGR but located close to the stop codon of the translated ORF, supporting a model in which transcription is coupled to translation and translocating ribosomes abrogate transcription termination. Our data also showed that the signal tolerated some sequence variations, since mutation into 5'-GCAGC-3' was functional, and 5'-GUAGC-3' is likely the signal for the termination of the 3' end of the L mRNA."
"The Journal of general virology","The viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp; L protein) of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV; family Bunyaviridae) is a 238 kDa protein that is crucial for the life cycle of the virus, as it catalyses both transcription of viral mRNAs and replication of the tripartite genome. Despite its importance, little is known about the intracellular distribution of the polymerase or its other roles during infection, primarily because of lack of specific antibodies that recognize L protein. To begin to address these questions we investigated whether the RVFV (MP12 strain) polymerase could tolerate insertion of the V5 epitope, as has been previously demonstrated for the Bunyamwera virus L protein. Insertion of the 14 aa epitope into the polymerase sequence at aa 1852 resulted in a polymerase that retained functionality in a minigenome assay, and we were able to rescue recombinant viruses that expressed the modified L protein by reverse genetics. The L protein could be detected in infected cells by Western blotting with anti-V5 antibodies. Examination of recombinant virus-infected cells by immunofluorescence revealed a punctate perinuclear or cytoplasmic distribution of the polymerase that co-localized with the nucleocapsid protein. The generation of RVFV expressing a tagged RdRp will allow detailed examination of the role of the viral polymerase in the virus life cycle."

"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a zoonotic disease endemic in Africa and the Arabian Peninsula caused by the highly infectious Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) that can be lethal to humans and animals and results in major losses in the livestock industry. RVF is exotic to the United States; however, mosquito species native to this region can serve as biological vectors for the virus. Thus, accidental or malicious introduction of this virus could result in RVFV becoming endemic in North America. Such an event would likely lead to significant morbidity and mortality in humans, and devastating economic effects on the livestock industry. Currently, there are no licensed vaccines for RVF that are both safe and efficacious. To address this issue, we developed two recombinant RVFV vaccines using vaccinia virus (VACV) as a vector for use in livestock. The first vaccine, vCOGnGc, was attenuated by the deletion of a VACV gene encoding an IFN-γ binding protein, insertional inactivation of the thymidine kinase gene, and expression of RVFV glycoproteins, Gn and Gc. The second vaccine, vCOGnGcγ, is identical to the first and also expresses the human IFN-γ gene to enhance safety. Both vaccines are extremely safe; neither resulted in weight loss nor death in severe combined immunodeficient mice, and pock lesions were smaller in baboons compared with the controls. Furthermore, both vaccines induced protective levels of antibody titers in vaccinated mice and baboons. Mice were protected from lethal RVFV challenge. Thus, we have developed two safe and efficacious recombinant vaccines for RVF."
"The Journal of general virology","The family Bunyaviridae of segmented, negative-stranded RNA viruses includes over 350 members that infect a bewildering variety of animals and plants. Many of these bunyaviruses are the causative agents of serious disease in their respective hosts, and are classified as emerging viruses because of their increased incidence in new populations and geographical locations throughout the world. Emerging bunyaviruses, such as Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, tomato spotted wilt virus and Rift Valley fever virus, are currently attracting great interest due to migration of their arthropod vectors, a situation possibly linked to climate change. These and other examples of continued emergence suggest that bunyaviruses will probably continue to pose a sustained global threat to agricultural productivity, animal welfare and human health. The threat of emergence is particularly acute in light of the lack of effective preventative or therapeutic treatments for any of these viruses, making their study an important priority. This review presents recent advances in the understanding of the bunyavirus life cycle, including aspects of their molecular, cellular and structural biology. Whilst special emphasis is placed upon the emerging bunyaviruses, we also describe the extensive body of work involving model bunyaviruses, which have been the subject of major contributions to our overall understanding of this important group of viruses."
"Computational and mathematical methods in medicine","The basic reproductive ratio, R(0), is one of the fundamental concepts in mathematical biology. It is a threshold parameter, intended to quantify the spread of disease by estimating the average number of secondary infections in a wholly susceptible population, giving an indication of the invasion strength of an epidemic: if R(0) < 1, the disease dies out, whereas if R(0) > 1, the disease persists. R(0) has been widely used as a measure of disease strength to estimate the effectiveness of control measures and to form the backbone of disease-management policy. However, in almost every aspect that matters, R(0) is flawed. Diseases can persist with R(0) < 1, while diseases with R(0) > 1 can die out. We show that the same model of malaria gives many different values of R(0), depending on the method used, with the sole common property that they have a threshold at 1. We also survey estimated values of R(0) for a variety of diseases, and examine some of the alternatives that have been proposed. If R(0) is to be used, it must be accompanied by caveats about the method of calculation, underlying model assumptions and evidence that it is actually a threshold. Otherwise, the concept is meaningless."
"PLoS neglected tropical diseases","In endemic areas, Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a significant threat to both human and animal health. Goals of this study were to measure human anti-RVFV seroprevalence in a high-risk area following the 2006-2007 Kenyan Rift Valley Fever (RVF) epidemic, to identify risk factors for interval seroconversion, and to monitor individuals previously exposed to RVFV in order to document the persistence of their anti-RVFV antibodies.We conducted a village cohort study in Ijara District, Northeastern Province, Kenya. One hundred two individuals tested for RVFV exposure before the 2006-2007 RVF outbreak were restudied to determine interval anti-RVFV seroconversion and persistence of humoral immunity since 2006. Ninety-two additional subjects were enrolled from randomly selected households to help identify risk factors for current seropositivity. Overall, 44/194 or 23% (CI(95%):17%-29%) of local residents were RVFV seropositive. 1/85 at-risk individuals restudied in the follow-up cohort had seroconverted since early 2006. 27/92 (29%, CI(95%): 20%-39%) of newly tested individuals were seropositive. All 13 individuals with positive titers (by plaque reduction neutralization testing (PRNT₈₀) in 2006 remained positive in 2009. After adjustment in multivariable logistic models, age, village, and drinking raw milk were significantly associated with RVFV seropositivity. Visual impairment (defined as ≤ 20/80) was much more likely in the RVFV-seropositive group (P<0.0001).Our results highlight significant variability in RVFV exposure in two neighboring villages having very similar climate, terrain, and insect density. Among those with previous exposure, RVFV titers remained at > 1∶40 for more than 3 years. In concordance with previous studies, residents of the more rural village were more likely to be seropositive and RVFV seropositivity was associated with poor visual acuity. Raw milk consumption was strongly associated with RVFV exposure, which may represent an important new focus for public health education during future RVF outbreaks."
"Journal of virological methods","The presence of competent vectors in some countries currently free of Rift Valley fever (RVF) and global changes in climate, travel and trade have increased the risk of RVF spreading to new regions and have emphasised the need for accurate and reliable diagnostic tools for early diagnosis during RVF outbreaks. Highly sensitive viral detection systems like PCR have a limited use during outbreaks because of the short duration of viraemia, whereas antibodies like specific IgM which are serological indicators of acute infection, can be detected for up to 50 days after infection. Using the highly conserved and immunogenic recombinant nucleoprotein of RVF virus in an IgM capture ELISA, the risk of laboratory infection associated with traditional serological methods is avoided. The use of pre-coated/pre-blocked ELISA plates and the conjugation of the recombinant nucleoprotein with horseradish peroxidase simplified and shortened the assay procedure. Results showed the assay to be highly reproducible with a lower detection limit equal to that of a commercial competition ELISA. By receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis the area under curve (AUC) index was determined as 1.0 and the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity at a PP cut-off value of 4.1 as 100% and 99.78% respectively. The results of this study demonstrated that the IgM capture ELISA is a safe, reliable and highly accurate diagnostic tool which can be used on its own or in parallel with other methods for the early diagnosis of RVF virus infection and also for monitoring of immune responses in vaccinated domestic ruminants.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

"Revue scientifique et technique (International Office of Epizootics)","While the international trade in small ruminants and small ruminant products is small relative to the trade in bovine, swine and poultry products, it is still economically important. In addition to wool, it includes some unique products (such as goat and sheep milk cheeses, cashmere fibre and karakul pelts) and the sheep/goat meat trade plays a large part in sustaining livelihoods in several regions of the world. The trade in small ruminants and their products also merits consideration because sheep and goats may transmit zoonotic diseases such as Rift Valley fever, Crimean Congo haemorrhagic fever, brucellosis and listeriosis. They also may transmit highly infectious livestock diseases, such as peste des petits ruminants, to naïve populations of small ruminants in other countries. This can have dramatic consequences, particularly for poor people whose livelihood often depends on small ruminants. In addition, sheep and goats can serve as an important source of foot and mouth disease (FMD) for cattle. This has enormous global trade implications and it is important, therefore, that sheep and goats be considered in FMD control programmes aimed at improving access to trade."
"Journal of invertebrate pathology","The baculovirus-insect cell expression system is a well-established technology for the production of heterologous viral (glyco)proteins in cultured cells, applicable for basic scientific research as well as for the development and production of vaccines and diagnostics. Arboviruses form an emerging group of medically important viral pathogens that are transmitted to humans and animals via arthropod vectors, mostly mosquitoes, ticks or midges. Few arboviral vaccines are currently available, but there is a growing need for safe and effective vaccines against some highly pathogenic arboviruses such as Chikungunya, dengue, West Nile, Rift Valley fever and Bluetongue viruses. This comprehensive review discusses the biology and current state of the art in vaccine development for arboviruses belonging to the families Togaviridae, Flaviviridae, Bunyaviridae and Reoviridae and the potential of the baculovirus-insect cell expression system for vaccine antigen production The members of three of these four arbovirus families have enveloped virions and display immunodominant glycoproteins with a complex structure at their surface. Baculovirus expression of viral antigens often leads to correctly folded and processed (glyco)proteins able to induce protective immunity in animal models and humans. As arboviruses occupy a unique position in the virosphere in that they also actively replicate in arthropod cells, the baculovirus-insect cell expression system is well suited to produce arboviral proteins with correct folding and post-translational processing. The opportunities for recombinant baculoviruses to aid in the development of safe and effective subunit and virus-like particle vaccines against arboviral diseases are discussed.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

"Emerging infectious diseases","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) has been the cause of disease outbreaks throughout Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, and the infection often results in heavy economic costs through loss of livestock. If RVFV, which is common to select agent lists of the US Department of Health and Human Services and the US Department of Agriculture, entered the United States, either by accidental or purposeful means, the effects could be substantial. A group of subject matter experts met in December 2009 to discuss potential implications of an introduction of RVF to the United States and review current modeling capabilities. This workshop followed a similar meeting held in April 2007. This report summarizes the 2 workshop proceedings. Discussions primarily highlighted gaps in current economic and epidemiologic RVF models as well as gaps in the overall epidemiology of the virus."
"Journal of virology","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV; family Bunyaviridae) is a clinically important, mosquito-borne pathogen of both livestock and humans, which is found mainly in sub-Saharan Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. RVFV has a trisegmented single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) genome. The L and M segments are negative sense and encode the L protein (viral polymerase) on the L segment and the virion glycoproteins Gn and Gc as well as two other proteins, NSm and 78K, on the M segment. The S segment uses an ambisense coding strategy to express the nucleocapsid protein, N, and the nonstructural protein, NSs. Both the NSs and NSm proteins are dispensable for virus growth in tissue culture. Using reverse genetics, we generated a recombinant virus, designated r2segMP12, containing a two-segmented genome in which the NSs coding sequence was replaced with that for the Gn and Gc precursor. Thus, r2segMP12 lacks an M segment, and although it was attenuated in comparison to the three-segmented parental virus in both mammalian and insect cell cultures, it was genetically stable over multiple passages. We further show that the virus can stably maintain an M-like RNA segment encoding the enhanced green fluorescent protein gene. The implications of these findings for RVFV genome packaging and the potential to develop multivalent live-attenuated vaccines are discussed."
"Virology journal","Arthorpod-borne viruses (arboviruses) cause wide-spread morbidity in sub-Saharan Africa, but little research has documented the burden and distribution of these pathogens.Using a population-based, cross-sectional study design, we administered a detailed questionnaire and used ELISA to test the blood of 1,141 healthy Kenyan adults from three districts for the presence of anti-viral Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to the following viruses: dengue (DENV), West Nile (WNV), yellow fever (YFV), Chikungunya (CHIKV), and Rift Valley fever (RVFV).Of these, 14.4% were positive for DENV, 9.5% were WNV positive, 9.2% were YFV positive, 34.0% were positive for CHIKV and 0.7% were RVFV positive. In total, 46.6% had antibodies to at least one of these arboviruses.For all arboviruses, district of residence was strongly associated with seropositivity. Seroprevalence to YFV, DENV and WNV increased with age, while there was no correlation between age and seropositivity for CHIKV, suggesting that much of the seropositivity to CHIKV is due to sporadic epidemics. Paradoxically, literacy was associated with increased seropositivity of CHIKV and DENV."
"The Journal of infectious diseases","Rhesus macaques given 5 × 10(4) or 1 × 10(5) plaque-forming units (pfu) of Rift Valley fever (RVF) MP-12 vaccine by oral, intranasal drops, or small particle aerosol showed no adverse effects up to 56 days after administration. All monkeys given the vaccine by aerosol or intranasal drops developed 80% plaque reduction neutralization titers of ≥ 1:40 by day 21 after inoculation. Only 2 of 4 monkeys given the vaccine by oral instillation developed detectable neutralizing antibodies. All monkeys vaccinated by mucosal routes that developed detectable neutralizing antibodies were protected against viremia when challenged with 1 × 10(5) pfu of virulent RVF virus delivered by a small particle aerosol at 56 days after vaccination. A single inoculation of the RVF MP-12 live attenuated vaccine by the aerosol or intranasal route may provide an alternative route of protective immunization to RVFV in addition to conventional intramuscular injection."
"South African medical journal = Suid-Afrikaanse tydskrif vir geneeskunde","During 2008, Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus re-emerged in South Africa as focal outbreaks in several provinces.To investigate an outbreak affecting cattle farmers and farm workers, and the staff and students of a veterinary school, assess the prevalence of infection during the outbreak, document the clinical presentation of cases, and identify potential risk factors.We conducted a cross-sectional serological survey of exposed veterinarians and farmers, who were examined to determine the presence of current or recent illness. Blood specimens were collected for virus isolation, nucleic acid detection and serology. A subset was interviewed using a standardised questionnaire to obtain data on recent exposures and risk factors for infection.Of 53 participants potentially exposed to infected domestic ruminants, 15% had evidence of recent infection and 4% evidence of past exposure to the RVF virus. The prevalence of acute infection was 21% in veterinarians compared with 9% in farmers and farm workers. After a mean incubation period of 4.3 days, the most frequent symptoms experienced included myalgia (100%), headache (88%) and malaise (75%). No asymptomatic cases were identified. Transmission, by direct contact with infected animals was the major risk factor in these professional groups. Performing animal autopsies was significantly associated with acute infection (risk ratio 16.3, 95% confidence interval 2.3 - 114.2).Increased risks associated with veterinary practices highlight a need for the use of personal protective equipment, and identify veterinarians as a primary target group for future vaccination."
"Cell host & microbe","During natural transmission, bunyaviruses are introduced into the skin through arthropod bites, and dermal dendritic cells (DCs) are the first to encounter incoming viruses. DC-SIGN is a C-type lectin highly expressed on the surface of dermal DCs. We found that several arthropod-borne phleboviruses (Bunyaviridae), including Rift Valley fever and Uukuniemi viruses, exploit DC-SIGN to infect DCs and other DC-SIGN-expressing cells. DC-SIGN binds the virus directly via interactions with high-mannose N-glycans on the viral glycoproteins and is required for virus internalization and infection. In live cells, virus-induced clustering of cell surface DC-SIGN could be visualized. An endocytosis-defective mutant of DC-SIGN was unable to mediate virus uptake, indicating that DC-SIGN is an authentic receptor required for both attachment and endocytosis. After internalization, viruses separated from DC-SIGN and underwent trafficking to late endosomes. Our study provides real-time visualization of virus-receptor interactions on the cell surface and establishes DC-SIGN as a phlebovirus entry receptor.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

While the abortion rates on beef and dairy cattle farms usually do not exceed 10%, significant economic losses because of abortion storms may be encountered. Determining the cause of abortions is usually a challenge, and it generally remains obscure in more than 50% of the necropsy submitted foetuses. Bovine viral diarrhoea virus and bovine herpesvirus-1 are the most common viruses causally associated with bovine abortions in farmed cattle globally. Rift Valley fever virus and bluetongue virus are important insect-transmitted abortogenic viruses. The geographic distribution of these two viruses is primarily dependent on the distribution of the insect vector, but direct transmission is possible. Recent global warming and subsequent insect vector expansion, coupled with the increase in international trade of animals and animal products, have been important factors in recent geographic advances of those two viruses.

"Viruses","Rift Valley fever (RVF) is an emerging zoonotic disease distributed in sub-Saharan African countries and the Arabian Peninsula. The disease is caused by the Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) of the family Bunyaviridae and the genus Phlebovirus. The virus is transmitted by mosquitoes, and virus replication in domestic ruminant results in high rates of mortality and abortion. RVFV infection in humans usually causes a self-limiting, acute and febrile illness; however, a small number of cases progress to neurological disorders, partial or complete blindness, hemorrhagic fever, or thrombosis. This review describes the pathology of RVF in human patients and several animal models, and summarizes the role of viral virulence factors and host factors that affect RVFV pathogenesis."
"Vaccine","Two modified live attenuated vaccines against the disease Rift Valley fever (RVF) have been tested for safety and efficacy in young calves. The RVF Smithburn vaccine produced in South Africa and used successfully to prevent and control the disease in endemic sub-Saharan countries was compared to the candidate vaccine RVF Clone 13. Five sero-negative calves per vaccine group were vaccinated with a single dose of each vaccine and tested for antibody response. All vaccinated calves were challenged with a highly virulent RVF virus together with five unvaccinated calves used as control of the challenge. Protection was confirmed in all vaccinated animals as they did not show any clinical signs typical of RVF. A good neutralizing antibody response was induced post-vaccination and no viraemia could be detected post-challenge in calves of both vaccine groups. All non-vaccinated control animals showed clinical symptoms of RVF, high viraemia and were euthanized. This study reported the first case of blindness in cattle resulting from virulent RVF virus infection in unvaccinated calves used as negative controls.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

"Journal of medical entomology","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) causes outbreaks of severe disease in domestic ungulates as well as humans in Africa. There is a logical concern that RVFV could be introduced into the Americas and cause significant health and economic damage based on the precedent of the introduction and spread of West Nile virus (WNV). Unfortunately, there are currently no licensed diagnostic assays available for RVFV in the Americas. In this work, we report on the ability of a novel dipstick assay, VectorTest RVFV antigen assay, modeled on the VecTest assay for WNV, to detect a RVFV-infected female within a pool of mosquitoes. The dipsticks provided results in <20 min, were easy to use, and did not require a laboratory with containment facilities. Although readily able to detect a mosquito with a disseminated RVFV infection, it only occasionally detected RVFV in a mosquito with a nondisseminated infection, and therefore may fail to detect some pools that actually contain one or more positive mosquitoes. The RVFV dipstick assay was highly specific and did not react with samples to which had been added yellow fever, West Nile, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, sandfly fever Naples, sandfly fever Sicilian, or sandfly fever Toscana viruses. The RVFV assay can provide a rapid, safe, easy-to-use assay to alert public health personnel to the presence of RVFV in mosquitoes. Results from this assay will allow a rapid threat assessment and the focusing of vector control measures in high-risk areas."
"PloS one","Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a zoonotic disease caused by Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV). RVFV is a category A pathogen that belongs to the genus Phlebovirus, family Bunyaviridae. Understanding early host events to an infectious exposure to RVFV will be of significant use in the development of effective therapeutics that not only control pathogen multiplication, but also contribute to cell survival. In this study, we have carried out infections of human cells with a vaccine strain (MP12) and virulent strain (ZH501) of RVFV and determined host responses to viral infection. We demonstrate that the cellular antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) displays altered abundances at early time points following exposure to the virus. We show that the enzyme is down regulated in cases of both a virulent (ZH501) and a vaccine strain (MP12) exposure. Our data demonstrates that the down regulation of SOD1 is likely to be due to post transcriptional processes and may be related to up regulation of TNFα following infection. We also provide evidence for extensive oxidative stress in the MP12 infected cells. Concomitantly, there is an increase in the activation of the p38 MAPK stress response, which our earlier published study demonstrated to be an essential cell survival strategy. Our data suggests that the viral anti-apoptotic protein NSm may play a role in the regulation of the cellular p38 MAPK response. Alterations in the host protein SOD1 following RVFV infection appears to be an early event that occurs in multiple cell types. Activation of the cellular stress response p38 MAPK pathway can be observed in all cell types tested. Our data implies that maintaining oxidative homeostasis in the infected cells may play an important role in improving survival of infected cells."
"Bioengineered bugs","Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is an avian virus that is being evaluated as a vaccine vector for the delivery of foreign genes in mammals. The use of NDV as a vaccine vector in these species offers two major advantages. First, NDV is highly attenuated in mammals, rendering its use inherently safe. Second, mammals lack pre-existing NDV immunity, which minimizes the risk of vaccination failure. NDV-vector vaccines are generally administered to mammals via the respiratory route. We recently showed that intramuscular vaccination with NDV-based Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) vaccines provides complete protection in mice and induces neutralizing antibodies in sheep and cattle, the main target species of RVFV. Here, we discuss the use of NDV as a vaccine vector for applications in mammalian livestock with an emphasis on the vaccination route. We also report the results of novel experiments that underscore our notion that vaccination via a parenteral route is more effective than immunization via the respiratory route.© 2011 Landes Bioscience"
"PLoS neglected tropical diseases","Most arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) are RNA viruses, which are maintained in nature by replication cycles that alternate between arthropod and vertebrate hosts. Arboviruses appear to experience lower rates of evolution than RNA viruses that replicate in a single host. This genetic stability is assumed to result from a fitness trade-off imposed by host alternation, which constrains arbovirus genome evolution. To test this hypothesis, we used Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), an arbovirus that can be transmitted either directly (between vertebrates during the manipulation of infected tissues, and between mosquitoes by vertical transmission) or indirectly (from one vertebrate to another by mosquito-borne transmission).RVFV was serially passaged in BHK21 (hamster) or Aag2 (Aedes aegypti) cells, or in alternation between the two cell types. After 30 passages, these single host-passaged viruses lost their virulence and induced protective effects against a challenge with a virulent virus. Large deletions in the NSs gene that encodes the virulence factor were detectable from the 15(th) serial passage onwards in BHK21 cells and from the 10(th) passage in Aag2 cells. The phosphoprotein NSs is not essential to viral replication allowing clones carrying deletions in NSs to predominate as they replicate slightly more rapidly. No genetic changes were found in viruses that were passaged alternately between arthropod and vertebrate cells. Furthermore, alternating passaged viruses presenting complete NSs gene remained virulent after 30 passages.Our results strongly support the view that alternating replication is necessary to maintain the virulence factor carried by the NSs phosphoprotein."
"Parasitology research","Mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) are important vectors of human disease-causing pathogens. Mosquitoes are found both in rural and urban areas. Deteriorating infrastructure, poor access to health, water and sanitation services, increasing population density, and widespread poverty contribute to conditions that modify the environment, which directly influences the risk of disease within the urban and peri-urban ecosystem. The objective of this study was to evaluate the mosquito vector abundance and diversity in urban, peri-urban, and rural strata in Malindi along the Kenya coast. The study was conducted in the coastal district of Malindi between January and December 2005. Three strata were selected which were described as urban, peri-urban, and rural. Sampling was done during the wet and dry seasons. Sampling in the wet season was done in the months of April and June to cover the long rainy season and in November and December to cover the short rainy season, while the dry season was between January and March and September and October. Adult mosquito collection was done using Pyrethrum Spray Collection (PSC) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) light traps inside houses and specimens were identified morphologically. In the three strata (urban, peri-urban, and rural), 78.5% of the total mosquito (n = 7,775) were collected using PSC while 18.1% (n = 1,795) were collected using the CDC light traps. Using oviposition traps, mosquito eggs were collected and reared in the insectary which yielded 329 adults of which 83.8% (n = 276) were Aedes aegypti and 16.2% (n = 53) were Culex quinquefasciatus. The mosquito distribution in the three sites varied significantly in each collection site. Anopheles gambiae, Anopheles funestus and Anopheles coustani were predominant in the rural stratum while C. quinquefasciatus was mostly found in urban and peri-urban strata. However, using PSC and CDC light trap collection techniques, A. aegypti was only found in urban strata. In the three strata, mosquitoes were mainly found in high numbers during the wet season. Further, A. gambiae, C. quinquefasciatus, and A. aegypti mosquitoes were found occurring together inside the houses. This in turn exposes the inhabitants to an array of mosquito-borne diseases including malaria, bancroftian filariasis, and arboviruses (dengue fever, Yellow fever, Rift Valley fever, Chikungunya fever, and West Nile Virus). In conclusion, our findings provide useful information for the design of integrated mosquito and disease control programs in East African environments."
"Acta biotheoretica","Rift Valley Fever is a vector-borne disease mainly transmitted by mosquito. To gain some quantitative insights into its dynamics, a deterministic model with mosquito, livestock, and human host is formulated as a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations and analyzed. The disease threshold [Formula: see text] is computed and used to investigate the local stability of the equilibria. A sensitivity analysis is performed and the most sensitive model parameters to the measure of initial disease transmission [Formula: see text] and the endemic equilibrium are determined. Both [Formula: see text] and the disease prevalence in mosquitoes are more sensitive to the natural mosquito death rate, d(m). The disease prevalence in livestock and humans are more sensitive to livestock and human recruitment rates, [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text], respectively, suggesting isolation of livestock from humans is a viable preventive strategy during an outbreak. Numerical simulations support the analytical results in further exploring theoretically the long-term dynamics of the disease at the population level."
"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","Vector infection by some animal-infecting parasites results in altered feeding that enhances transmission. Modification of vector behavior is of broad adaptive significance, as parasite fitness relies on passage to a new host, and vector feeding is nearly always essential for transmission. Although several plant viruses infect their insect vectors, we have shown that vector infection by a plant virus alters feeding behavior. Here we show that infection with Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV), type member of the only plant-infecting genus in the Bunyaviridae, alters the feeding behavior of its thrips vector, Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande). Male thrips infected with TSWV fed more than uninfected males, with the frequency of all feeding behaviors increasing by up to threefold, thus increasing the probability of virus inoculation. Importantly, infected males made almost three times more noningestion probes (probes in which they salivate, but leave cells largely undamaged) compared with uninfected males. A functional cell is requisite for TSWV infection and cell-to-cell movement; thus, this behavior is most likely to establish virus infection. Some animal-infecting members of the Bunyaviridae (La Crosse virus and Rift Valley fever virus) also cause increased biting rates in infected vectors. Concomitantly, these data support the hypothesis that capacity to modify vector feeding behavior is a conserved trait among plant- and animal-infecting members of the Bunyaviridae that evolved as a mechanism to enhance virus transmission. Our results underscore the evolutionary importance of vector behavioral modification to diverse parasites with host ranges spanning both plant and animal kingdoms."

"PLoS pathogens","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), a Phlebovirus with a genome consisting of three single-stranded RNA segments, is spread by infected mosquitoes and causes large viral outbreaks in Africa. RVFV encodes a nucleoprotein (N) that encapsidates the viral RNA. The N protein is the major component of the ribonucleoprotein complex and is also required for genomic RNA replication and transcription by the viral polymerase. Here we present the 1.6 Å crystal structure of the RVFV N protein in hexameric form. The ring-shaped hexamers form a functional RNA binding site, as assessed by mutagenesis experiments. Electron microscopy (EM) demonstrates that N in complex with RNA also forms rings in solution, and a single-particle EM reconstruction of a hexameric N-RNA complex is consistent with the crystallographic N hexamers. The ring-like organization of the hexamers in the crystal is stabilized by circular interactions of the N terminus of RVFV N, which forms an extended arm that binds to a hydrophobic pocket in the core domain of an adjacent subunit. The conformation of the N-terminal arm differs from that seen in a previous crystal structure of RVFV, in which it was bound to the hydrophobic pocket in its own core domain. The switch from an intra- to an inter-molecular interaction mode of the N-terminal arm may be a general principle that underlies multimerization and RNA encapsidation by N proteins from Bunyaviridae. Furthermore, slight structural adjustments of the N-terminal arm would allow RVFV N to form smaller or larger ring-shaped oligomers and potentially even a multimer with a super-helical subunit arrangement. Thus, the interaction mode between subunits seen in the crystal structure would allow the formation of filamentous ribonucleocapsids in vivo. Both the RNA binding cleft and the multimerization site of the N protein are promising targets for the development of antiviral drugs."
"Acta tropica","In June, 2003, Egypt's hospital-based electronic disease surveillance system began to record increased cases of acute febrile illness from governorates in the Nile Delta. In response to a request for assistance from the Egyptian Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization (WHO), the U.S. Naval Medical Research Unit No. 3 (NAMRU-3) provided assistance in identifying the cause and extent of this outbreak. Testing of human clinical samples (n=375) from nine governorates in Egypt identified 29 cases of RVF viremia that spanned the period of June to October, and a particular focus of disease in Kafr el Sheikh governorate (7.7% RVF infection rate). Veterinary samples (n=101) collected during this time in Kafr el Sheikh and screened by immunoassay for RVFV-specific IgM identified probable recent infections in cattle (10.4%) and sheep (5%). Entomologic investigations that focused in rural, rice growing villages in the Sidi Salim District of Kafr el Sheikh during August-September, 2003, collected, identified, and tested host-seeking female mosquitoes for the presence of pathogenic viruses. Three isolates of RVF virus (RVFV) were obtained from 297 tested pools of female mosquitoes and all three RVFV isolates came from Cx. antennatus (Becker). While Cx. pipiens has been considered the primary vector of RVF virus in Egypt and is often the most common man-biting species found, Cx. antennatus was the dominant species captured at the 2003 outbreak location in Kafr el Sheikh governorate. This is the first time that Cx. antennatus has been found naturally infected with RVFV in Egypt.Published by Elsevier B.V."
"Vaccine","Current vaccine candidates against Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) incorporate the viral structural glycoproteins as antigens, since triggering antibody responses against them usually correlates with protection. Here, we have focused solely on the nucleoprotein of RVFV as a potential target for vaccine development. Previous studies in mouse models have already demonstrated that RVFV nucleoprotein can elicit partial protection when administered by means of a DNA vaccine or in recombinant, soluble, protein form. To determine whether this partially protective immune response could be augmented to a level comparable to DNA constructs encoding for RVFV glycoproteins, several targeting sequences were cloned adjacent to the RVFV nucleoprotein (N) gene. Immunization with a plasmid construct encoding for a ubiquitinated form of the viral nucleoprotein (pCMV-Ub-N) significantly increased the survival of IFNAR(-/-) mice following viral challenge to levels comparable with a recombinant DNA-vaccine encoding both RVFV glycoproteins. Mice immunized with pCMV-Ub-N also displayed higher levels of non-neutralizing anti-N antibodies and antigen-specific T-cell responses. This suggests a role for other cell mediated responses in protection against RVFV. These findings show the potential of RVFV N as a candidate antigen for vaccination, and present a new strategy in vaccine design against certain bunyaviruses, where glycoprotein variation may impede effective broad-based vaccination strategies.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

"Vector borne and zoonotic diseases (Larchmont, N.Y.)","Rift Valley fever (RVF) is an emerging vector-borne zoonotic disease that represents a threat to human health, animal health, and livestock production, particularly in Africa. The epidemiology of RVF is not well understood, so that forecasting RVF outbreaks and carrying out efficient and timely control measures remains a challenge. Various epidemiological modeling tools have been used to increase knowledge on RVF epidemiology and to inform disease management policies.This narrative review gives an overview of modeling tools used to date to measure or model RVF risk in animals, and presents how they have contributed to increasing our understanding of RVF occurrence or informed RVF surveillance and control strategies.Systematic literature searches were performed in PubMed and ISI Web of Knowledge. Additional research work was identified from other sources.Literature was scarce. Research work was highly heterogeneous in methodology, level of complexity, geographic scale of approach, and geographical area of study. Gaps in knowledge and data were frequent, and uncertainty was not always explored. Spatial approaches were the most commonly utilized techniques and have been used at both local and continental scales, the latter leading to the implementation of an early warning system. Three articles using dynamic transmission models explored the potential of RVF endemicity. Risk factor studies identified water-related environmental risk factors associated with RVF occurrence in domestic livestock. Risk assessments identified importation of infected animals, contaminated products, or infected vectors as key risk pathways for the introduction of RVF virus into disease-free areas.Enhanced outbreak prediction and control and increased knowledge on RVF epidemiology would benefit from additional field data, continued development, and refinement of modeling techniques for exploring plausible disease transmission mechanisms and the impact of intervention strategies."
"Journal of virology","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV; family Bunyaviridae, genus Phlebovirus) is an important emerging pathogen of humans and ruminants. Its NSs protein has previously been identified as a major virulence factor that suppresses host defense through three distinct mechanisms: it directly inhibits beta interferon (IFN-β) promoter activity, it promotes the degradation of double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR), and it suppresses host transcription by disrupting the assembly of the basal transcription factor TFIIH through sequestration of its p44 subunit. Here, we report that in addition to PKR, NSs also promotes the degradation of the TFIIH subunit p62. Infection of cells with the RVFV MP-12 vaccine strain reduced p62 protein levels to below the detection limit early in the course of infection. This NSs-mediated downregulation of p62 was posttranslational, as it was unaffected by pharmacological inhibition of transcription or translation and MP-12 infection had no effect on p62 mRNA levels. Treatment of cells with proteasome inhibitors but not inhibition of lysosomal acidification or nuclear export resulted in a stabilization of p62 in the presence of NSs. Furthermore, p62 could be coprecipitated with NSs from lysates of infected cells. These data suggest that the RVFV NSs protein is able to interact with the TFIIH subunit p62 inside infected cells and promotes its degradation, which can occur directly in the nucleus."
"Journal of virology","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), a mosquito-borne phlebovirus, has been detected in Madagascar since 1979, with occasional outbreaks. In 2008 to 2009, a large RVFV outbreak was detected in Malagasy livestock and humans during two successive rainy seasons. To determine whether cases were due to enzootic maintenance of the virus within Madagascar or to importation from the East African mainland, nine RVFV whole genomic sequences were generated for viruses from the 1991 and 2008 Malagasy outbreaks. Bayesian coalescent analyses of available whole S, M, and L segment sequences were used to estimate the time to the most recent common ancestor for the RVFVs. The 1979 Madagascar isolate shared a common ancestor with strains on the mainland around 1972. The 1991 Madagascar isolates were in a clade distinct from that of the 1979 isolate and shared a common ancestor around 1987. Finally, the 2008 Madagascar viruses were embedded within a large clade of RVFVs from the 2006-2007 outbreak in East Africa and shared a common ancestor around 2003 to 2004. These results suggest that the most recent Madagascar outbreak was caused by a virus likely arriving in the country some time between 2003 and 2008 and that this outbreak may be an extension of the 2006-2007 East African outbreak. Clustering of the Malagasy sequences into subclades indicates that the viruses have continued to evolve during their short-term circulation within the country. These data are consistent with the notion that RVFV outbreaks in Madagascar result not from emergence from enzootic cycles within the country but from recurrent virus introductions from the East African mainland."
"The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is an emerging biodefense pathogen that poses significant threats to human and livestock health. To date, the interepidemic reservoirs of RVFV are not well defined. In a longitudinal survey of infectious diseases among African buffalo during 2000-2006, 550 buffalo were tested for antibodies against RVFV in 820 capture events in 302 georeferenced locations in Kruger National Park, South Africa. Overall, 115 buffalo (21%) were seropositive. Seroprevalence of RVFV was highest (32%) in the first study year, and decreased progressively in subsequent years, but had no detectable impact on survival. Nine (7%) of 126 resampled, initially seronegative animals seroconverted during periods outside any reported regional RVFV outbreaks. Seroconversions for RVFV were detected in significant temporal clusters during 2001-2003 and in 2004. These findings highlight the potential importance of wildlife as reservoirs for RVFV and interepidemic RVFV transmission in perpetuating regional RVFV transmission risk."
"Journal of virology","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a zoonotic pathogen that primarily affects ruminants but can also be lethal in humans. A negative-stranded RNA virus of the family Bunyaviridae, this pathogen is transmitted mainly via mosquito vectors. RVFV has shown the ability to inflict significant damage to livestock and is also a threat to public health. While outbreaks have traditionally occurred in sub-Saharan Africa, recent outbreaks in the Middle East have raised awareness of the potential of this virus to spread to Europe, Asia, and the Americas. Although the virus was initially characterized almost 80 years ago, the only vaccine approved for widespread veterinary use is an attenuated strain that has been associated with significant pathogenic side effects. However, increased understanding of the molecular biology of the virus over the last few years has led to recent advances in vaccine design and has enabled the development of more-potent prophylactic measures to combat infection. In this review, we discuss several aspects of RVFV, with particular emphasis on the molecular components of the virus and their respective roles in pathogenesis and an overview of current vaccine candidates. Progress in understanding the epidemiology of Rift Valley fever has also enabled prediction of potential outbreaks well in advance, thus providing another tool to combat the physical and economic impact of this disease."
"PloS one","The Rift Valley fever virus is responsible for periodic, explosive epizootics throughout sub-Saharan Africa. The development of therapeutics targeting this virus is difficult due to a limited understanding of the viral replicative cycle. Utilizing a virus-like particle system, we have established roles for each of the viral structural components in assembly, release, and virus infectivity. The envelope glycoprotein, Gn, was discovered to be necessary and sufficient for packaging of the genome, nucleocapsid protein and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase into virus particles. Additionally, packaging of the genome was found to be necessary for the efficient release of particles, revealing a novel mechanism for the efficient generation of infectious virus. Our results identify possible conserved targets for development of anti-phlebovirus therapies."
"Future virology","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is an important animal and human threat and leads to longstanding morbidity and mortality in susceptible hosts. Since no therapies currently exist to treat Rift Valley fever, it remains a public and animal health priority to develop safe, effective RVFV vaccines (whether for animals, humans, or both) that provide long-term protective immunity. In the evaluated article, Bhardwaj and colleagues describe the creation and testing of two successful vaccine strategies against RVFV, a DNA plasmid vaccine expressing Gn coupled to C3d, and an alpha-virus replicon vaccine expressing Gn protein. Both vaccines elicited strong neutralizing antibody responses, prevented morbidity and mortality in RVFV-challenged mice, and enabled protection of naive mice via passive antibody transfer from vaccinated mice. Both DNA and replicon RVFV vaccines have previously been shown to protect against RVFV challenge, but these results allow for direct comparison of the two methods and evaluation of a combined prime-boost method. The results also highlight the specific humoral and cell-mediated immune responses to vaccination."
"East African journal of public health","Communicable disease outbreaks cause millions of deaths throughout Sub-Saharan Africa each year. Most of the diseases causing epidemics in the region have been nearly eradicated or brought under control in other parts of the world. In recent years, considerable effort has been directed toward public health initiatives and strategies with a potential for significant impact in the fight against infectious diseases. In 1998, the World Health Organization African Regional Office (WHO/AFRO) launched the Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) strategy aimed at mitigating the impact of communicable diseases, including epidemic-prone diseases, through improving surveillance, laboratory confirmation and appropriate and timely public health interventions. Over the past decade, WHO and its partners have been providing technical and financial resources to African countries to strengthen epidemic preparedness and response (EPR) activities.This review examined the major epidemics reported to WHO/AFRO from 2003 to 2007. we conduct a review of documents and reports obtained from WHO/AFRO, WHO inter-country team, and partners and held meeting and discussions with key stakeholders to elicit the experiences of local, regional and international efforts against these epidemics to evaluate the lessons learned and to stimulate discussion on the future course for enhancing EPR.The most commonly reported epidemic outbreaks in Africa include: cholera, dysentery, malaria and hemorrhagic fevers (e.g. Ebola, Rift Valley fever, Crimean-Congo fever and yellow fever). The cyclic meningococcal meningitis outbreak that affects countries along the ""meningitis belt"" (spanning Sub-Saharan Africa from Senegal and The Gambia to Kenya and Ethiopia) accounts for other major epidemics in the region. The reporting of disease outbreaks to WHO/AFRO has improved since the launch of the IDSR strategy in 1998. Although the epidemic trends for cholera showed a decline in case fatality rate (CFR) suggesting improvement in detection and quality of response by the health sector, the number of countries affected has increased. Major epidemic diseases continue to occur in most countries in the region. Among the major challenges to overcome are: poor coordination of EPR, weak public health infrastructure, lack of trained workers and inconsistent supply of diagnostic, treatment and prevention commodities.To successfully reduce the levels of morbidity and mortality resulting from epidemic outbreaks, urgent and long-term investments are needed to strengthen capacities for early detection and timely and effective response. Effective advocacy, collaboration and resource mobilization efforts involving local health officials, governments and the international community are critically needed to reduce the heavy burden of disease outbreaks on African populations."
"BMC public health","The Armed Forces Health Surveillance Center, Division of Global Emerging Infections Surveillance and Response System Operations (AFHSC-GEIS) initiated a coordinated, multidisciplinary program to link data sets and information derived from eco-climatic remote sensing activities, ecologic niche modeling, arthropod vector, animal disease-host/reservoir, and human disease surveillance for febrile illnesses, into a predictive surveillance program that generates advisories and alerts on emerging infectious disease outbreaks. The program's ultimate goal is pro-active public health practice through pre-event preparedness, prevention and control, and response decision-making and prioritization. This multidisciplinary program is rooted in over 10 years experience in predictive surveillance for Rift Valley fever outbreaks in Eastern Africa. The AFHSC-GEIS Rift Valley fever project is based on the identification and use of disease-emergence critical detection points as reliable signals for increased outbreak risk. The AFHSC-GEIS predictive surveillance program has formalized the Rift Valley fever project into a structured template for extending predictive surveillance capability to other Department of Defense (DoD)-priority vector- and water-borne, and zoonotic diseases and geographic areas. These include leishmaniasis, malaria, and Crimea-Congo and other viral hemorrhagic fevers in Central Asia and Africa, dengue fever in Asia and the Americas, Japanese encephalitis (JE) and chikungunya fever in Asia, and rickettsial and other tick-borne infections in the U.S., Africa and Asia."
"Vector borne and zoonotic diseases (Larchmont, N.Y.)","A Rift Valley fever (RVF) outbreak occurred in Madagascar from January to May 2008. The objectives of this study were (1) to assess the current and past circulation of RVF virus (RVFV) in livestock in Madagascar and (2) to evaluate the extent and magnitude of the 2008 RVF outbreak in livestock. The results of a country-wide serosurvey conducted in August 2008 on small and large ruminants are reported here. The study included 3437 cattle and 989 small ruminants (227 sheep and 762 goats) sampled in 30 of the 111 Malagasy districts, selected to be representative of the different ecozones and livestock density areas. Sera of animals were tested for the detection of immunoglobulins M (IgM) and G (IgG) against RVFV using commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays kits. Recent infections (presence of IgM against RVFV) were detected in only 9 cattle (0.3% [0.1-0.4]) and 33 small ruminant (3.3% [2.2-4.5]) samples. Past infections (presence of IgG and absence of IgM against RVFV) were detected in 887 cattle (25.8% [24.3-27.3]) and 244 small ruminant (24.7% [22.0-27.4]) samples. Past infections were detected in all sampled sites. All ecozones were affected. In the southern and northwestern areas, the prevalence of cattle showing evidence of past infection with RVFV increased with the age of the animals. Our results suggest that there has been country-wide circulation of RVFV in 2008 in Madagascar, including in parts of the country where no clinical illness, either in animals or in humans, was reported. The data also suggest that the southern and northwestern areas may be endemic for RVFV, and that the virus may spread when ecological conditions are favorable for its amplification."
"Vaccine","An investigational, formalin-inactivated Rift Valley fever (RVF) vaccine, known as The Salk Institute-Government Services Division (TSI-GSD) 200 vaccine, was administered to 1860 at-risk subjects (5954 doses) between 1986 and 2004 as a three-dose primary series (days 0, 7, and 28) followed by booster doses as needed for declining titers. An initial positive serological response (PRNT(80)≥1:40) to the primary series was observed in 90% of subjects. Estimate of the PRNT(80) response half-life in initial responders to the primary series by Kaplan-Meier plot was 315 days after the primary series dose 3. Differences in a serological response were observed at 2 weeks after dose 3 of the primary series between vaccine lots and for gender (women>men); a trend was observed for age (<40 years). When response to the primary series was measured by PRNT(50) titer ≥1:40, nearly all subjects (99.1%) responded. In individuals not initially responding to the primary series (PRNT(80)<1:40), a response was observed in most subjects after receiving only one booster dose. Immune response (all subjects) to subsequent booster doses for a declining titer (PRNT(80)<1:40) was 98.4%. The vaccine was well-tolerated; vaccine-related adverse reactions were generally mild and self-limited. Differences in adverse events were observed with vaccine lot and sex. The data support the safety and immunogenicity of the inactivated RVF vaccine, and may serve as a standard of comparison for immunogenicity and safety for future RVF vaccines.Published by Elsevier Ltd."
"Journal of zoo and wildlife medicine : official publication of the American Association of Zoo Veterinarians","One hundred serum samples collected from free-ranging white rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum) in Kruger National Park (KNP) during the 2007 capture season were selected for measurement of antibody levels to several different vector-borne viral agents. These infectious diseases were chosen to compare with an earlier serosurvey that had been conducted in KNP in rhinos during 1987-1997. Positive antibody titers were found against epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD) of deer (8%), Bluetongue (BT) (1%), and Rift Valley fever (RVF) (49%). However, none of the 100 animals tested had detected antibody levels to African horse sickness (AHS). These values were in sharp contrast to those measured in the 1987-1997 survey in KNP white rhinos (AHS 60%, EHD 30%, BT 37%, RVF 0%). Vector-borne viral infection prevalence in white rhinos in the same geographical location appears to vary over time and may be important for monitoring presence of pathogens in an ecosystem."
"Virus research","Infection of small laboratory animals by Punta Toro virus (PTV), family Bunyaviridae, genus Phlebovirus, is a model for the study of the human pathogen Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV). We have identified inbred mouse strains with significant differences in host response to the Adames strain of PTV. Nine inbred strains of mice representing major branches in the Mus musculus phylogeny were inoculated subcutaneously with a high dose of PTV in survival experiments. Two inbred strains of mice, NZW/LacJ and 129S1/SvImJ, died ~4 days after PTV infection, whereas 7 other strains survived the challenge and showed no clinical signs of disease. Histologically, 129S1/SvImJ mice showed massive hepatocellular necrosis and had additional lesions in lung, brain, and spleen, whereas NZW/LacJ mice had mild piecemeal hepatocellular necrosis. PTV viral loads in the livers of infected mice were determined by reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR. Inbred mice from strains that showed clinical signs and succumbed to PTV infection had higher liver viral loads than did mice of resistant strains. Hybrid F₁ mice were generated by crossing susceptible 129S1 and resistant FVB/N mice and tested for susceptibility. The hybrid F₁ mice showed significantly higher viral loads in the liver than the resistant parental FVB/N mice, suggesting that susceptibility is dominant. These findings will enable an unbiased genetic approach to identify host genes mediating susceptibility to PTV.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"Journal of clinical microbiology","The aim of this study was to develop a highly sensitive and specific one-step multiplex reverse transcriptase PCR assay for the simultaneous and differential detection of Rift Valley Fever virus (RVFV), bluetongue virus (BTV), rinderpest virus (RPV), and Peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV). These viruses cause mucosal lesions in cattle, sheep, and goats, and they are difficult to differentiate from one another based solely on their clinical presentation in suspected disease cases. In this study, we developed a multiplex reverse transcriptase PCR to detect these viruses using a novel dual-priming oligonucleotide (DPO). The DPO contains two separate priming regions joined by a polydeoxyinosine linker, which blocks extension of nonspecifically primed templates and consistently allows high PCR specificity even under less-than-optimal PCR conditions. A total of 19 DPO primers were designed to detect and discriminate between RVFV, BTV, RPV, and PPRV by the generation of 205-, 440-, 115-, and 243-bp cDNA products, respectively. The multiplex reverse transcriptase PCR described here enables the early diagnosis of these four viruses and may also be useful as part of a testing regime for cattle, sheep, or goats exhibiting similar clinical signs, including mucosal lesions."
"Médecine et maladies infectieuses","The authors describe clinical and epidemiologic characteristics of severe presentations of Rift valley fever (RVF) during the 2008 epidemic in Madagascar.The diagnosis was confirmed by RVF virus polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or detection of specifics antibodies by Elisa.Sixteen cases of severe RVF were recorded. The sex-ratio was 7/1 and median age was 32 years (20/59 years). The risk factors of infection were: contact with infected animals or their meat (n=8), and travelling to a risk area (n=2). Hemorrhagic, neurological, and ocular manifestations were observed respectively in 87.5%, 43.8% and 6.3% of cases. All patients who died (n=4) presented with a hemorrhagic form of the disease.The hemorrhagic form was the most frequent presentation of RVF and was responsible for a high level of mortality.

"Médecine et maladies infectieuses","Rift Valley Fever (RVF) is a zoonotic arbovirosis. Among animals, it mainly affects ruminants, causing abortions in gravid females and mortality among young animals. In humans, RVF virus infection is usually asymptomatic or characterized by a moderate fever. However, in 1 to 3% of cases, more severe forms of the disease (hepatitis, encephalitis, retinitis, hemorrhagic fever) can lead to the death of infected individuals or to major sequels. The RVF virus (Bunyaviridae, genus Phlebovirus) was identified for the first time in the 1930s in Kenya. It then spread over almost all African countries, sometimes causing major epizootics/epidemics. In 2000, the virus was carried out of Africa, in the Middle East Arabian Peninsula. In 2007-2008, Eastern-African countries, including Madagascar, reported significant episodes of RVF virus, this was also the case for the Comoros archipelago and the French island of Mayotte. This ability to spread associated with many vectors, including in Europe, and high viral loads in infected animals led the health authorities worldwide to warn about the potential emergence of RVF virus in areas with a temperate climate. The awareness has increased in recent years with climate changes, which may possibly modify the vector distribution and competence, and prompted many RVF virus-free countries to better prepare for a potential implantation of RVF.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS.

"Emerging infectious diseases","Few studies have investigated the many mosquito species that harbor arboviruses in Kenya. During the 2006-2007 Rift Valley fever outbreak in North Eastern Province, Kenya, exophilic mosquitoes were collected from homesteads within 2 affected areas: Gumarey (rural) and Sogan-Godud (urban). Mosquitoes (n = 920) were pooled by trap location and tested for Rift Valley fever virus and West Nile virus. The most common mosquitoes trapped belonged to the genus Culex (75%). Of 105 mosquito pools tested, 22% were positive for Rift Valley fever virus, 18% were positive for West Nile virus, and 3% were positive for both. Estimated mosquito minimum infection rates did not differ between locations. Our data demonstrate the local abundance of mosquitoes that could propagate arboviral infections in Kenya and the high prevalence of vector arbovirus positivity during a Rift Valley fever outbreak."
"Journal of the American Mosquito Control Association","Rift Valley fever (RVF), a disease of ruminants and humans, has been responsible for large outbreaks in Africa that have resulted in hundreds of thousands of human infections and major economic disruption due to loss of livestock and to trade restrictions. As indicated by the rapid spread of West Nile viral activity across North America since its discovery in 1999 and the rapid and widespread movement of chikungunya virus from Africa throughout the Indian Ocean Islands to Asia and Europe, an introduced exotic arbovirus can be rapidly and widely established across wide geographical regions. Although RVF virus (RVFV) is normally transmitted by mosquitoes, we wanted to determine the potential for this virus to replicate in 2 of the most globally distributed and common higher flies: house flies, Musca domestica, and stable flies, Stomoxys calcitrans. Neither species supported the replication of RVFV, even after intrathoracic inoculation. However, S. calcitrans was able to mechanically transmit RVFV to susceptible hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) after probing on infected hamsters with high viral titers. Therefore, S. calcitrans, because of its close association with domestic animals that serve as amplifying hosts of RVFV, should be considered a possible mechanical vector of RVFV, and it may contribute to the rapid spread of a RVF outbreak. Other Stomoxys species present in Africa and elsewhere may also play similar roles."
"Vector borne and zoonotic diseases (Larchmont, N.Y.)","Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a major vector-borne zoonosis first identified on the African continent in the early 1900s. In 2000, RVF was reported for the first time in Yemen. In this study, we provide a descriptive analysis of the period 1999-2007 in Yemen, taking into account the environmental and socioeconomic factors likely to have been involved in the emergence of RVF in the country. We characterize each year in the study period by the environmental conditions (linked to vegetation indexes), the festival calendar, and economic data. We then use a principal component analysis to synthesize the different variables, assess whether the year 2000 was atypical compared with other years in the study period, and, if that was the case, in what respect. Our results show that 2000 presented above-normal vegetation index values, which reflect important precipitation, for both the two rainy seasons (the first between March and May; the second between July and October). These environmental conditions, ones favorable to mosquito vector populations, coincided that year with a late (March) starting date of the Eid al-Kabeer festival, which corresponds to a period with high host (cattle, sheep, goats) densities. According to these criteria, 2000 was an atypical year. These conclusions suggest that it is important to consider social variables in addition to environmental ones when assessing the risk of RVF emergence."
"The Journal of infectious diseases","During the Rift Valley fever (RVF) epidemic of 2006-2007 in eastern Africa, spatial mapping of the outbreaks across Kenya, Somalia, and Tanzania was performed and the RVF viruses were isolated and genetically characterized.Following confirmation of the RVF epidemic in Kenya on 19 December 2006 and in Tanzania on 2 February 2007, teams were sent to the field for case finding. Human, livestock, and mosquito specimens were collected and viruses isolated. The World Health Organization response team in Kenya worked with the WHO's polio surveillance team inside Somalia to collect information and specimens from Somalia.Seven geographical foci that reported hundreds of livestock and >25 cases in humans between December 2006 and June 2007 were identified. The onset of RVF cases in each epidemic focus was preceded by heavy rainfall and flooding for at least 10 days. Full-length genome analysis of 16 RVF virus isolates recovered from humans, livestock, and mosquitoes in 5 of the 7 outbreak foci revealed 3 distinct lineages of the viruses within and across outbreak foci.The findings indicate that the sequential RVF epidemics in the region were caused by multiple lineages of the RVF virus, sometimes independently activated or introduced in distinct outbreak foci."
"PLoS neglected tropical diseases","Nucleoproteins (NPs) encapsidate the Phlebovirus genomic (-)RNA. Upon recombinant expression, NPs tend to form heterogeneous oligomers impeding characterization of the encapsidation process through crystallographic studies. To overcome this problem, we set up a standard protocol in which production under both non-denaturing and denaturing/refolding conditions can be investigated and compared. The protocol was applied for three phlebovirus NPs, allowing an optimized production strategy for each of them. Remarkably, the Rift Valley fever virus NP was purified as a trimer under native conditions and yielded protein crystals whereas the refolded version could be purified as a dimer. Yields of trimeric Toscana virus NP were higher from denaturing than from native condition and lead to crystals. The production of Sandfly Fever Sicilian virus NP failed in both protocols. The comparative protocols described here should help in rationally choosing between denaturing or non-denaturing conditions, which would finally result in the most appropriate and relevant oligomerized protein species. The structure of the Rift Valley fever virus NP has been recently published using a refolded monomeric protein and we believe that the process we devised will contribute to shed light in the genome encapsidation process, a key stage in the viral life cycle."
"Veterinaria italiana","Rift Valley fever (RVF) is an arthropod-borne zoonotic disease of livestock. It is characterised by fever, salivation, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, mucopurulent to bloody nasal discharge, abortion, rapid decrease in milk production and death in animals. Infected humans experience an influenza-like illness that is characterised by fever, malaise, headaches, nausea and epigastric pain followed by recovery, although mortality can occur. RVF was thought to be a disease of sub-Saharan Africa but with the outbreaks in Egypt and the Arabian Peninsula, it may be extending its range further afield. Virological and serological evidence indicates that the virus exists in Nigeria and, with the warning signal sent by international organisations to countries in Africa about an impending outbreak, co-ordinated research between veterinarians and physicians in Nigeria is advocated."
"Population health metrics","Globally, arthropod-borne virus infections are increasingly common causes of severe febrile disease that can progress to long-term physical or cognitive impairment or result in early death. Because of the large populations at risk, it has been suggested that these outcomes represent a substantial health deficit not captured by current global disease burden assessments.We reviewed newly available data on disease incidence and outcomes to critically evaluate the disease burden (as measured by disability-adjusted life years, or DALYs) caused by yellow fever virus (YFV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV), and Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV). We searched available literature and official reports on these viruses combined with the terms ""outbreak(s),"" ""complication(s),"" ""disability,"" ""quality of life,"" ""DALY,"" and ""QALY,"" focusing on reports since 2000. We screened 210 published studies, with 38 selected for inclusion. Data on average incidence, duration, age at onset, mortality, and severity of acute and chronic outcomes were used to create DALY estimates for 2005, using the approach of the current Global Burden of Disease framework.Given the limitations of available data, nondiscounted, unweighted DALYs attributable to YFV, JEV, CHIKV, and RVFV were estimated to fall between 300,000 and 5,000,000 for 2005. YFV was the most prevalent infection of the four viruses evaluated, although a higher proportion of the world's population lives in countries at risk for CHIKV and JEV. Early mortality and long-term, related chronic conditions provided the largest DALY components for each disease. The better known, short-term viral febrile syndromes caused by these viruses contributed relatively lower proportions of the overall DALY scores.Limitations in health systems in endemic areas undoubtedly lead to underestimation of arbovirus incidence and related complications. However, improving diagnostics and better understanding of the late secondary results of infection now give a first approximation of the current disease burden from these widespread serious infections. Arbovirus control and prevention remains a high priority, both because of the current disease burden and the significant threat of the re-emergence of these viruses among much larger groups of susceptible populations."
"Veterinary research","Rift Valley fever(RVF) virus is an arbovirus in the Bunyaviridae family that, from phylogenetic analysis, appears to have first emerged in the mid-19th century and was only identified at the beginning of the 1930's in the Rift Valley region of Kenya. Despite being an arbovirus with a relatively simple but temporally and geographically stable genome, this zoonotic virus has already demonstrated a real capacity for emerging in new territories, as exemplified by the outbreaks in Egypt (1977), Western Africa (1988) and the Arabian Peninsula (2000), or for re-emerging after long periods of silence as observed very recently in Kenya and South Africa. The presence of competent vectors in countries previously free of RVF, the high viral titres in viraemic animals and the global changes in climate, travel and trade all contribute to make this virus a threat that must not be neglected as the consequences of RVF are dramatic, both for human and animal health. In this review, we present the latest advances in RVF virus research. In spite of this renewed interest, aspects of the epidemiology of RVF virus are still not fully understood and safe, effective vaccines are still not freely available for protecting humans and livestock against the dramatic consequences of this virus."
"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","The Bunyaviridae family includes pathogens of medical and veterinary importance. Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), a member in the Phlebovirus genus of the family Bunyaviridae, is endemic to sub-Saharan Africa and causes a mosquito-borne disease in ruminants and humans. Viruses in the family Bunyaviridae carry a tripartite, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA genome composed of L, M, and S RNAs. Little is known about how the three genomic RNA segments are copackaged to generate infectious bunyaviruses. We explored the mechanism that governs the copackaging of the three genomic RNAs into RVFV particles. The expression of viral structural proteins along with replicating S and M RNAs resulted in the copackaging of both RNAs into RVFV-like particles, while replacing M RNA with M1 RNA, lacking a part of the M RNA 5' UTR, abrogated the RNA copackaging. L RNA was efficiently packaged into virus particles released from cells supporting the replication of L, M, and S RNAs, and replacing M RNA with M1 RNA abolished the packaging of L RNA. Detailed analyses using various combinations of replicating viral RNAs suggest that M RNA alone or a coordinated function of M and S RNAs exerted efficient L RNA packaging either directly or indirectly. Collectively, these data are consistent with the possibility that specific intermolecular interactions among the three viral RNAs drive the copackaging of these RNAs to produce infectious RVFV."
"Bulletin de la Société de pathologie exotique (1990)","The mosquito Culex pipiens has been involved as vector of the West Nile virus in Tunisia. Its bio-ecological characteristics in combination with some environmental factors have favoured the emergence of this virus in a West-Nile free zone. This leads to question about the potential risk of introducing another arbovirus, the Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus, in Tunisia from neighbouring countries where RVF circulates. In this study, we have evaluated the vector competence of different populations of Cx. pipiens towards two strains of RVF virus, the virulent ZH548 and the avirulent Clone 13 by experimental infections and the genetic differentiation of these populations of Cx. pipiens using four microsatellite loci. We found disseminated infection rates ranging from 0% to 14.7% and a high genetic differentiation among populations without any geographical pattern (no isolation by distance). Thus, although Cx. pipiens is able to sustain an amplification of RVF virus, viral dissemination through mosquito dispersal would be unlikely. However, as RVF is an emerging disease transmitted by several other potential mosquito species (e.g. Ochlerotatus caspius), attention should be maintained to survey livestock and mosquitoes in Tunisia."
"Annals of tropical medicine and parasitology","Mosquito-borne diseases continue to be a serious public-health concern in Australia. Endemic alphaviruses (including Ross River and Barmah Forest viruses) account for the majority of the arboviral notifications, while some flaviviruses (Murray Valley encephalitis, Japanese encephalitis and Kunjin viruses) cause occasional outbreaks of encephalitis. Dengue epidemics are increasing in frequency in northern Queensland, with the largest outbreak in 50 years occurring during the 2008-2009 wet season. Of great concern are the threats posed by the importation of exotic arboviruses, such as West Nile, chikungunya and Rift Valley fever viruses, the introduction of exotic vectors, and the potential range expansion of key Australian vectors. Environmental and anthropogenic influences provide additional uncertainty regarding the future impact of mosquito-borne pathogens in Australia. This review discusses the trends, threats and challenges that face the management of mosquito-borne disease in Australia. Topical mosquito-borne pathogens of biosecurity and public-health concern, and the potential impacts of environmental and global trends, are discussed. Finally, a short overview of the public-health response capability in Australia is provided."
"PloS one","As an arthropod-borne human pathogen, Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) cycles between an insect vector and mammalian hosts. Little is known about the cellular requirements for infection in either host. Here we developed a tissue culture model for RVFV infection of human and insect cells that is amenable to high-throughput screening. Using this approach we screened a library of 1280 small molecules with pharmacologically defined activities and identified 59 drugs that inhibited RVFV infection with 15 inhibiting RVFV replication in both human and insect cells. Amongst the 15 inhibitors that blocked infection in both hosts was a subset that inhibits protein kinase C. Further studies found that infection is dependent upon the novel protein kinase C isozyme epsilon (PKCε) in both human and insect cells as well as in adult flies. Altogether, these data show that inhibition of cellular factors required for early steps in the infection cycle including PKCε can block RVFV infection, and may represent a starting point for the development of anti-RVFV therapeutics."
"Geospatial health","Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus is a mosquito-borne phlebovirus of the Bunyaviridae family that causes frequent outbreaks of severe animal and human disease in sub-Saharan Africa, Egypt and the Arabian Peninsula. Based on its many known competent vectors, its potential for transmission via aerosolization, and its progressive spread from East Africa to neighbouring regions, RVF is considered a high-priority, emerging health threat for humans, livestock and wildlife in all parts of the world. Introduction of West Nile virus to North America has shown the potential for ""exotic"" viral pathogens to become embedded in local ecological systems. While RVF is known to infect and amplify within domestic livestock, such as taurine cattle, sheep and goats, if RVF virus is accidentally or intentionally introduced into North America, an important unknown factor will be the role of local wildlife in the maintenance or propagation of virus transmission. We examined the potential impact of RVF transmission via white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in a typical north-eastern United States urban-suburban landscape, where livestock are rare but where these potentially susceptible, ungulate wildlife are highly abundant. Model results, based on overlap of mosquito, human and projected deer densities, indicate that a significant proportion (497/1186 km(2), i.e. 42%) of the urban and peri-urban landscape could be affected by RVF transmission during the late summer months. Deer population losses, either by intervention for herd reduction or by RVF-related mortality, would substantially reduce these likely transmission zones to 53.1 km(2), i.e. by 89%."
"Geospatial health","In the vicinity of the Barkedji village (in the Ferlo region of Senegal), the abundance and aggressiveness of the vector mosquitoes for Rift Valley fever (RVF) are strongly linked to rainfall events and associated ponds dynamics. Initially, these results were obtained from spectral analysis of high-resolution (~10 m) Spot-5 images, but, as a part of the French AdaptFVR project, identification of the free water dynamics within ponds was made with the new high-resolution (down to 3-meter pixels), Synthetic Aperture Radar satellite (TerraSAR-X) produced by Infoterra GmbH, Friedrichshafen/Potsdam, Germany. During summer 2008, within a 30 x 50 km radar image, it was found that identified free water fell well within the footprints of ponds localized by optical data (i.e. Spot-5 images), which increased the confidence in this new and complementary remote sensing technique. Moreover, by using near real-time rainfall data from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), NASA/JAXA joint mission, the filling-up and flushing-out rates of the ponds can be accurately determined. The latter allows for a precise, spatio-temporal mapping of the zones potentially occupied by mosquitoes capable of revealing the variability of pond surfaces. The risk for RVF infection of gathered bovines and small ruminants (~1 park/km(2)) can thus be assessed. This new operational approach (which is independent of weather conditions) is an important development in the mapping of risk components (i.e. hazards plus vulnerability) related to RVF transmission during the summer monsoon, thus contributing to a RVF early warning system."
"PloS one","Rift valley fever virus (RVFV) infection is an emerging zoonotic disease endemic in many countries of sub-Saharan Africa and in Egypt. In this study we show that human small airway epithelial cells are highly susceptible to RVFV virulent strain ZH-501 and the attenuated strain MP-12. We used the reverse-phase protein arrays technology to identify phosphoprotein signaling pathways modulated during infection of cultured airway epithelium. ZH-501 infection induced activation of MAP kinases (p38, JNK and ERK) and downstream transcriptional factors [STAT1 (Y701), ATF2 (T69/71), MSK1 (S360) and CREB (S133)]. NF-κB phosphorylation was also increased. Activation of p53 (S15, S46) correlated with the increased levels of cleaved effector caspase-3, -6 and -7, indicating activation of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. RVFV infection downregulated phosphorylation of a major anti-apoptotic regulator of survival pathways, AKT (S473), along with phosphorylation of FOX 01/03 (T24/31) which controls cell cycle arrest downstream from AKT. Consistent with this, the level of apoptosis inhibitor XIAP was decreased. However, the intrinsic apoptotic pathway marker, caspase-9, demonstrated only a marginal activation accompanied by an increased level of the inhibitor of apoptosome formation, HSP27. Concentration of the autophagy marker, LC3B, which often accompanies the pro-survival signaling, was decreased. Cumulatively, our analysis of RVFV infection in lung epithelium indicated a viral strategy directed toward the control of cell apoptosis through a number of transcriptional factors. Analyses of MP-12 titers in challenged cells in the presence of MAPK inhibitors indicated that activation of p38 represents a protective cell response while ERK activation controls viral replication."
"Vector borne and zoonotic diseases (Larchmont, N.Y.)","Following veterinary alerts of Rift Valley fever (RVF) in the districts of Fianarantsoa I and II in November 2008 and in the district of Ambalavao in April 2009, entomological and virological investigations were carried out to identify the mosquito species that could act as RVF virus (RVFV) vectors in the region. A total of 12,785 adult mosquitoes belonging to 5 genera and 21 species were collected. After identification, mosquitoes were pooled by species, sex, and female status (fed or unfed) and then stored at -80°C. Of 319 pools of unfed monospecific female mosquito tested by real-time RT-polymerase chain reaction, RVFV was detected in 1 pool of Anopheles coustani, 5 pools of An. squamosus, and 2 pools of Culex antennatus mosquitoes. The virus was isolated in mosquito cell lines from two of the five Real Time-RT-polymerase chain reaction (real time-RT-PCR) positive pools of An. squamosus mosquitoes. From the eight RVFV strains detected, partial S, M, and L genome segments sequences were obtained. The phylogenetic analysis of these sequences showed that the strains circulating in mosquitoes were genetically close to those that circulated in livestock and humans during RVF outbreaks in 2008 and 2009. This study, therefore, provides strong evidence that An. squamosus, An. coustani, and Cx. antennatus could play a role as vectors of the RVFV during the disease outbreaks in 2008-2009. Bioecological, genetic, and RVF transmission studies on these three mosquito species are needed to address this question and thus improve prevention and control of future RVF outbreaks in Madagascar, where these species are present."
"International journal of health geographics","Landscape attributes influence spatial variations in disease risk or incidence. We present a review of the key findings from eight case studies that we conducted in Europe and West Africa on the impact of land changes on emerging or re-emerging vector-borne diseases and/or zoonoses. The case studies concern West Nile virus transmission in Senegal, tick-borne encephalitis incidence in Latvia, sandfly abundance in the French Pyrenees, Rift Valley Fever in the Ferlo (Senegal), West Nile Fever and the risk of malaria re-emergence in the Camargue, and rodent-borne Puumala hantavirus and Lyme borreliosis in Belgium.We identified general principles governing landscape epidemiology in these diverse disease systems and geographic regions. We formulated ten propositions that are related to landscape attributes, spatial patterns and habitat connectivity, pathways of pathogen transmission between vectors and hosts, scale issues, land use and ownership, and human behaviour associated with transmission cycles.A static view of the ""pathogenecity"" of landscapes overlays maps of the spatial distribution of vectors and their habitats, animal hosts carrying specific pathogens and their habitat, and susceptible human hosts and their land use. A more dynamic view emphasizing the spatial and temporal interactions between these agents at multiple scales is more appropriate. We also highlight the complementarity of the modelling approaches used in our case studies. Integrated analyses at the landscape scale allows a better understanding of interactions between changes in ecosystems and climate, land use and human behaviour, and the ecology of vectors and animal hosts of infectious agents."
"Tropical animal health and production","Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a mosquito-borne viral zoonosis of increasing global importance. Occurring since 1930 across Africa, it was detected for the first time in Saudi Arabia and Yemen in September 2000, leading to human deaths and major losses in livestock populations. Assuming the virus has not survived in Yemen or has been circulating at a low level, authors qualitatively assessed the likelihood of ""re-introduction"" of RVF into Yemen through the legal importation of small ruminants from the Horn of Africa. The overall probability of introduction was assessed very low to medium, increasing during festival periods and higher when considering a direct transmission exposure as compared to a vectorial transmission exposure. The uncertainty was considered to be medium underlining important gaps in information that need to be fulfilled in the region. Options to reduce the risk are proposed and discussed, including possible improvements of the current Yemeni quarantine system."
"Journal of medical entomology","To determine which arthropods should be targeted for control should Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) be detected in North America, we evaluated Culex erraticus (Dyar and Knab), Culex erythrothorax Dyar, Culex nigripalpus Theobald, Culex pipiens L., Culex quinquefasciatus Say, Culex tarsalis Coquillett, Aedes dorsalis (Wiedemann), Aedes vexans (Meigen), Anopheles quadrimaculatus Say, and Culicoides sonorensis Wirth and Jones from the western, midwestern, and southern United States for their ability to transmit RVFV. Female mosquitoes were allowed to feed on adult hamsters inoculated with RVFV, after which engorged mosquitoes were incubated for 7-21 d at 260C, then allowed to refeed on susceptible hamsters, and tested to determine infection, dissemination, and transmission rates. Other specimens were inoculated intrathoracically, held for 7 d, and then allowed to feed on a susceptible hamster to check for a salivary gland barrier. When exposed to hamsters with viremias > or =10(8.8) plaque-forming units/ml blood, Cx. tarsalis transmitted RVFV efficiently (infection rate = 93%, dissemination rate = 56%, and estimated transmission rate = 52%). In contrast, when exposed to the same virus dose, none of the other species tested transmitted RVFV efficiently. Estimated transmission rates for Cx. erythrothorax, Cx. pipiens, Cx. erraticus, and Ae. dorsalis were 10, 8, 4, and 2%, respectively, and for the remaining species were < or = 1%. With the exception of Cx. tarsalis and Cx. pipiens, all species tested had moderate to major salivary gland barriers. None of the C. sonorensis became infected and none of the An. quadrimaculatus tested transmitted RVFV by bite, even after intrathoracic inoculation, indicating that these species would not be competent vectors of RVFV. Although Ae. vexans from Florida and Louisiana were relatively efficient vectors of RVFV, specimens of this species captured in Colorado or California were virtually incompetent, illustrating the need to evaluate local population for their ability to transmit a pathogen. In addition to laboratory vector competence, factors such as seasonal density, host feeding preference, longevity, and foraging behavior should be considered when determining the potential role that these species could play in RVFV transmission."
"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)","Rift Valley fever (RVF) is an arthropod-borne viral disease repeatedly reported in many African countries and, more recently, in Saudi Arabia and Yemen. RVF virus (RVFV) primarily infects domesticated ruminants, resulting in miscarriage in pregnant females and death for newborns and young animals. It also has the ability to infect humans, causing a feverish syndrome, meningoencephalitis, or hemorrhagic fever. The various outcomes of RVFV infection in animals and humans argue for the existence of host genetic determinants controlling the disease. We investigated the susceptibility of inbred mouse strains to infection with the virulent RVFV ZH548 strain. Compared with classical BALB/cByJ mice, wild-derived Mus m. musculus MBT/Pas mice exhibited earlier and greater viremia and died sooner, a result in sharp contrast with their resistance to infection with West Nile virus and influenza A. Infection of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from MBT/Pas mice with RVFV also resulted in higher viral production. Microarray and quantitative RT-PCR experiments showed that BALB/cByJ MEFs displayed a significant activation of the type I IFN pathway. In contrast, MBT/Pas MEFs elicited a delayed and partial type I IFN response to RVFV infection. RNA interference-mediated inhibition of genes that were not induced by RVFV in MBT/Pas MEFs increased viral production in BALB/cByJ MEFs, thus demonstrating their functional importance in limiting viral replication. We conclude that the failure of MBT/Pas murine strain to induce, in due course, a complete innate immune response is instrumental in the selective susceptibility to RVF."
"Clinical and vaccine immunology : CVI","Rift Valley fever (RVF) is an epizootic viral disease of sheep that can be transmitted from sheep to humans, particularly by contact with aborted fetuses. A capripoxvirus (CPV) recombinant virus (rKS1/RVFV) was developed, which expressed the Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) Gn and Gc glycoproteins. These expressed glycoproteins had the correct size and reacted with monoclonal antibodies (MAb) to native glycoproteins. Mice vaccinated with rKS1/RVFV were protected against RVFV challenge. Sheep vaccinated with rKS1/RVFV twice developed neutralizing antibodies and were significantly protected against RVFV and sheep poxvirus challenge. These findings further document the value of CPV recombinants as ruminant vaccine vectors and support the inclusion of RVFV genes encoding glycoproteins in multivalent recombinant vaccines to be used where RVF occurs."
"The Journal of general virology","Toscana virus (TOSV) is a phlebotomus-transmitted virus that belongs to the family Bunyaviridae and causes widespread infections in humans; about 30 % of these cases result in aseptic meningitis. In the present study, it was shown that TOSV is an inducer of beta interferon (IFN-β), although its non-structural protein (NSs) could inhibit the induction of IFN-β if expressed in a heterologous context. A recombinant Rift Valley fever virus expressing the TOSV NSs could suppress IFN-β expression in infected cells. Moreover, in cells expressing NSs protein from a cDNA plasmid, IFN-β transcripts were not inducible by poly(I : C). Unlike other members of the family Bunyaviridae, TOSV appears to express an NSs protein that is a weak antagonist of IFN induction. Characterization of the interaction of TOSV with the IFN system will help our understanding of virus-host cell interactions and may explain why the pathogenesis of this disease is mostly mild in humans."

"Vector borne and zoonotic diseases (Larchmont, N.Y.)","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), a member of the family Bunyaviridae, regularly accounts for large and severe outbreaks among humans and livestock in Africa and Arabia. Therefore, safe and efficient vaccines are highly needed. Here, we report the production of recombinant virus-like particles (VLPs) that, in addition to their similarity to RVFV particles, are able to express the viral nucleocapsid (N) gene. A single inoculation of 1 × 10(6) of these N-VLPs was sufficient to protect 100% of mice from infection with a lethal dose of 1 × 10(5) PFU of RVFV. Our study demonstrates that N-VLPs can be considered as a safe and efficient vaccine against the emerging pathogen RVFV, and that VLPs that actively produce a viral antigen may be considered a strategy to improve the immunogenicity of VLPs in general."
"Vector borne and zoonotic diseases (Larchmont, N.Y.)","Different enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based techniques for the detection of antibodies to Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) have been developed in recent years, but their diagnostic sensitivity was not directly compared. In addition, their use might still be restricted to high biocontainment facilities when sera to be tested are collected from viremic individuals. In this study, we report on direct comparison of various ELISA forms for the detection of anti-RVFV antibody in preinactivated sera using a simple thermochemical treatment. Results in naive and treated sera from experimentally infected sheep demonstrate that inactivation method used had no adverse effect on ELISA readings, but the assays analyzed differ in their ability to detect the early humoral responses to infection with RVFV. The IgM-capture ELISA was slightly more sensitive than the IgG-sandwich ELISA to detect early humoral response after infection. The indirect IgG ELISA, using Protein G Horseradish Peroxidase, was less sensitive in detecting seroconversion than the IgG-sandwich ELISA, but this problem was alleviated when using anti-sheep IgG conjugated with Horseradish Peroxidase. The high concentration of viral antigen in sheep sera collected shortly after infection might contribute to false-positive results in the inhibition ELISA, but its ability to detect seroconversion was comparable to that of IgM-capture ELISA."
"Vector borne and zoonotic diseases (Larchmont, N.Y.)","The increasing interest in Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) and its potential impact on naive animal populations deserve revisiting experimental reproduction of RVFV infection, particularly in those animal breeds for which no data about their susceptibility to RVFV infection have ever been recorded. In this study we show the susceptibility of 9-10 weeks old European sheep (Ripollesa breed) to RVFV infection, showing a mild, subacute form of disease. Four different viral isolates efficiently replicated in vivo after subcutaneous experimental inoculation, and consistent viral loads in blood and virus shedding (variable in length depending on the RVFV isolate used) were detected, showing horizontal transmission to a noninfected, sentinel lamb. RVFV infection caused transient pyrexia in adult lambs and no other clinical symptoms were observed, with the exception of corneal opacity (""blue eye"") found in 3 out of 16 subcutaneously inoculated sheep. In conclusion, adult sheep from this European breed are readily infected with RVFV without apparent clinical manifestations."
"Vector borne and zoonotic diseases (Larchmont, N.Y.)","Rift Valley fever virus continues to cause large outbreaks of acute and febrile illness among humans and domestic animals in Africa. The high pathogenicity of the virus is mainly due to the non-structural protein derived from the S segment NSs, which was shown to inhibit the type I interferon expression at the transcriptional level and to suppress host cell RNA synthesis. Clone 13, a naturally attenuated clone containing a deletion of 70% in NSs, is a promising vaccine candidate as it has no pathogenicity for mice and is highly immunogenic leading to long-lasting immunity. If Clone 13 succeeds in inducing a transient viremia in inoculated animals, is a mosquito vector able to replicate Clone 13 and is the vector affected by viral infection? In this work, we orally infected two mosquito species, Aedes vexans and Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus, with the avirulent Clone 13. We showed that the mosquito Ae. vexans better replicated the avirulent Clone 13 than Cx. p. quinquefasciatus. Moreover, infection with Clone 13 did not cause any important changes in mosquito's life-history traits compared to noninfected females. Nevertheless, it is likely that Clone 13 would not be efficiently transmitted by mosquito vectors."
"Virology","Detailed studies describing the pathogenesis of Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus (RVFV) in the mouse model are lacking. A fully characterized small animal model of RVF is needed to evaluate potential vaccines and therapeutics. In this study, we characterized the pathogenesis of RVFV throughout the disease course in mice. Infection produced high-titer viremia and demonstrated RVFV tropism for a variety of tissue and individual cell types. Overwhelming infection of hepatocytes, accompanied by apoptosis, was a major consequence of infection. The majority of mice died or were euthanatized between days 3 and 6 postinfection with severe hepatitis. The remaining mice effectively cleared virus from the liver and blood, but exhibited neuroinvasion and developed panencephalitis. In addition, we characterized a number of other virological, clinicopathological, and histopathological features of RVFV infection in mice. The mouse model therefore mimics both the acute-onset hepatitis and delayed-onset encephalitis that are dominant features of severe human RVF.Published by Elsevier Inc."

"Veterinary medicine international","Outbreaks of bovine ephemeral fever (BEF) occurred in Israel in 1990, 1999, and 2004. The main patterns of BEF spread were similar in the 1990 and in 1999 epidemics, and the BEF virus was probably carried in vectors transported by air streams across the Rift Valley and the Red Sea. In the 2004 outbreak, the primary focus of the disease was the southern Mediterranean coastal plain and the disease agent was apparently brought by infected mosquitoes carried from their breeding site in the Nile Delta by the south-western winds. The disease broke out under optimal ecological conditions, among a vulnerable cattle population and spread rapidly; it showed essentially a spring-summer herd incidence and terminated soon after the night average ambient temperature fell below 16 degrees C in late autumn. The herd incidence of the disease reached 78.4%, 97.7%, and 100% in 1990, 1999, and 2004, respectively. The highest herd incidence, morbidity, and case fatality rates were noted in dairy cattle herds in the Jordan Valley, with morbidity of 20%, 38.6%, and 22.2%, and case fatality rate among affected animals of 2%, 8.6%, and 5.4% in 1990, 1999, and 2004, respectively. The average sero-positivity to BEF in 1999 was 39.5%, which matched the morbidity rate. Comparison among the various age groups showed that the lowest morbidity rates were observed in the youngest age group, that is, heifers up to 1 year, with 3.2%, 3.6%, and 4.2% in 1990, 1999, and 2004, respectively. In heifers from 1 year to calving, the morbidity rates were 13.8%, 14.9%, and 28%, respectively, in first calvers 30.8%, 31.6%, and 28.3%, respectively, and in cows 34.3%, 35.7%, and 27.2%, respectively. All affected cattle were over the age of 3 months. It is hypothesized that mosquitoes and not Culicoides spp. are the vectors of the BEF virus in Israel."

"The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene","In East Africa, Rift Valley fever (RVF) usually occurs as explosive epizootics with prolonged inter-epidemic periods on the order of 8 to 10 years. The episodic nature of the disease and the rapid evolution of outbreaks create special challenges for its mitigation and control. Following the events of the 2006 and 2007 RVF outbreak in East Africa, decision-makers assembled their collective experiences in the form of a risk-based decision support tool to help guide responses in future emergencies. The premise of the tool is that a series of natural events are indicative of the increasing risk of an outbreak and that actions should be matched to this evolving risk profile. In this manner, investment in prevention and control can be qualitatively optimized. The decision support tool is a living document written through stakeholder input. This publication captures the current tool as an example of risk-based decision support."

"The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene","To capture lessons from the 2007 Rift Valley fever (RVF) outbreak, epidemiological studies were carried out in Kenya and Tanzania. Somali pastoralists proved to be adept at recognizing symptoms of RVF and risk factors such as heavy rainfall and mosquito swarms. Sandik, which means ""bloody nose,"" was used by Somalis to denote disease consistent with RVF. Somalis reported that sandik was previously seen in 1997/98, the period of the last RVF epidemic. Pastoralists communicated valuable epidemiological information for surveillance and early warning systems that was observed before international warnings. The results indicate that an all or none approach to decision making contributed to the delay in response. In the future, a phased approach balancing actions against increasing risk of an outbreak would be more effective. Given the time required to mobilize large vaccine stocks, emergency vaccination did not contribute to the mitigation of explosive outbreaks of RVF."
"The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene","We analyzed the extent of livestock involvement in the latest Rift Valley fever (RVF) outbreak in Kenya that started in December 2006 and continued until June 2007. When compared with previous RVF outbreaks in the country, the 2006-07 outbreak was the most extensive in cattle, sheep, goats, and camels affecting thousands of animals in 29 of 69 administrative districts across six of the eight provinces. This contrasted with the distribution of approximately 700 human RVF cases in the country, where over 85% of these cases were located in four districts; Garissa and Ijara districts in Northeastern Province, Baringo district in Rift Valley Province, and Kilifi district in Coast Province. Analysis of livestock and human data suggests that livestock infections occur before virus detection in humans, as supported by clustering of human RVF cases around livestock cases in Baringo district. The highest livestock morbidity and mortality rates were recorded in Garissa and Baringo districts, the same districts that recorded a high number of human cases. The districts that reported RVF in livestock for the first time in 2006/07 included Kitui, Tharaka, Meru South, Meru central, Mwingi, Embu, and Mbeere in Eastern Province, Malindi and Taita taveta in Coast Province, Kirinyaga and Murang'a in Central Province, and Baringo and Samburu in Rift Valley Province, indicating that the disease was occurring in new regions in the country."
"The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene","Although Rift Valley fever (RVF) has significant impacts on human health and livestock production, it can also induce significant (and often overlooked) economic losses among various stakeholders in the marketing chain. This work assesses and quantifies the multi-dimensional socio-economic impacts of the 2007 RVF outbreak in Kenya based on a rapid assessment of livestock value chains in the northeast part of the country and a national macroeconomic analysis. Although study results show negative impacts among producers in terms of food insecurity and reductions in income, we also found significant losses among other downstream actors in the value chain, including livestock traders, slaughterhouses, casual laborers, and butchers, as well as other, non-agricultural sectors. The study highlights the need for greater sensitivity and analyses that address the multitude of economic losses resulting from an animal disease to better inform policy and decision making during animal health emergencies."
"The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene","Historical outbreaks of Rift Valley fever (RVF) since the early 1950s have been associated with cyclical patterns of the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon, which results in elevated and widespread rainfall over the RVF endemic areas of Africa. Using satellite measurements of global and regional elevated sea surface temperatures, elevated rainfall, and satellite derived-normalized difference vegetation index data, we predicted with lead times of 2-4 months areas where outbreaks of RVF in humans and animals were expected and occurred in the Horn of Africa, Sudan, and Southern Africa at different time periods from September 2006 to March 2008. Predictions were confirmed by entomological field investigations of virus activity and by reported cases of RVF in human and livestock populations. This represents the first series of prospective predictions of RVF outbreaks and provides a baseline for improved early warning, control, response planning, and mitigation into the future."
"The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene","Rift Valley fever (RVF) is an important viral zoonotic disease in Africa with periodic outbreaks associated with severe disease, death, and economic hardship. During the 2006-2007 outbreaks in Eastern Africa, postmortem and necropsy tissue samples from 14 animals and 20 humans clinically suspected of RVF were studied with histopathologic evaluation and immunohistochemical (IHC) assays. Six animal and 11 human samples had IHC evidence of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) antigens. We found that extensive hepatocellular necrosis without prominent inflammatory cell infiltrates is the most distinctive histopathologic change in liver tissues infected with RVFV. Pathologic studies on postmortem tissue samples can help establish the diagnosis of RVF, differentiating from endemic diseases with clinical manifestations similar to RVF, such as malaria, leptospirosis, or yellow fever."
"The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene","In December 2006, Rift Valley fever (RVF) was diagnosed in humans in Garissa Hospital, Kenya and an outbreak reported affecting 11 districts. Entomologic surveillance was performed in four districts to determine the epidemic/epizootic vectors of RVF virus (RVFV). Approximately 297,000 mosquitoes were collected, 164,626 identified to species, 72,058 sorted into 3,003 pools and tested for RVFV by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Seventy-seven pools representing 10 species tested positive for RVFV, including Aedes mcintoshi/circumluteolus (26 pools), Aedes ochraceus (23 pools), Mansonia uniformis (15 pools); Culex poicilipes, Culex bitaeniorhynchus (3 pools each); Anopheles squamosus, Mansonia africana (2 pools each); Culex quinquefasciatus, Culex univittatus, Aedes pembaensis (1 pool each). Positive Ae. pembaensis, Cx. univittatus, and Cx. bitaeniorhynchus was a first time observation. Species composition, densities, and infection varied among districts supporting hypothesis that different mosquito species serve as epizootic/epidemic vectors of RVFV in diverse ecologies, creating a complex epidemiologic pattern in East Africa."
"The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene","In January 2007, an outbreak of Rift Valley fever (RVF) was detected among humans in northern Tanzania districts. By the end of the outbreak in June, 2007, 511 suspect RVF cases had been recorded from 10 of the 21 regions of Tanzania, with laboratory confirmation of 186 cases and another 123 probable cases. All confirmed RVF cases were located in the north-central and southern regions of the country, with an eventual fatality rate of 28.2% (N = 144). All suspected cases had fever; 89% had encephalopathy, 10% hemorrhage, and 3% retinopathy. A total of 169 (55%) of the 309 confirmed or probable cases were also positive for malaria as detected by peripheral blood smear. In a cohort of 20 RVF cases with known outcome that were also positive for human immunodeficiency virus, 15 (75%) died. Contact with sick animals and animal products, including blood, meat, and milk, were identified as major risk factors of acquiring RVF."
"The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene","A large Rift Valley fever (RVF) outbreak occurred in Kenya from December 2006 to March 2007. We conducted a study to define risk factors associated with infection and severe disease. A total of 861 individuals from 424 households were enrolled. Two hundred and two participants (23%) had serologic evidence of acute RVF infection. Of these, 52 (26%) had severe RVF disease characterized by hemorrhagic manifestations or death. Independent risk factors for acute RVF infection were consuming or handling products from sick animals (odds ratio [OR] = 2.53, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.78-3.61, population attributable risk percentage [PAR%] = 19%) and being a herds person (OR 1.77, 95% CI = 1.20-2.63, PAR% = 11%). Touching an aborted animal fetus was associated with severe RVF disease (OR = 3.83, 95% CI = 1.68-9.07, PAR% = 14%). Consuming or handling products from sick animals was associated with death (OR = 3.67, 95% CI = 1.07-12.64, PAR% = 47%).

"The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene","An outbreak of Rift Valley fever (RVF) occurred in Kenya during November 2006 through March 2007. We characterized the magnitude of the outbreak through disease surveillance and serosurveys, and investigated contributing factors to enhance strategies for forecasting to prevent or minimize the impact of future outbreaks. Of 700 suspected cases, 392 met probable or confirmed case definitions; demographic data were available for 340 (87%), including 90 (26.4%) deaths. Male cases were more likely to die than females, Case Fatality Rate Ratio 1.8 (95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.3-3.8). Serosurveys suggested an attack rate up to 13% of residents in heavily affected areas. Genetic sequencing showed high homology among viruses from this and earlier RVF outbreaks. Case areas were more likely than non-case areas to have soil types that retain surface moisture. The outbreak had a devastatingly high case-fatality rate for hospitalized patients. However, there were up to 180,000 infected mildly ill or asymptomatic people within highly affected areas. Soil type data may add specificity to climate-based forecasting models for RVF."

"PLoS neglected tropical diseases","Partial mosquito-proofing of houses with screens and ceilings has the potential to reduce indoor densities of malaria mosquitoes. We wish to measure whether it will also reduce indoor densities of vectors of neglected tropical diseases.The main house entry points preferred by anopheline and culicine vectors were determined through controlled experiments using specially designed experimental huts and village houses in Lupiro village, southern Tanzania. The benefit of screening different entry points (eaves, windows and doors) using PVC-coated fibre glass netting material in terms of reduced indoor densities of mosquitoes was evaluated compared to the control.23,027 mosquitoes were caught with CDC light traps; 77.9% (17,929) were Anopheles gambiae sensu lato, of which 66.2% were An. arabiensis and 33.8% An. gambiae sensu stricto. The remainder comprised 0.2% (50) An. funestus, 10.2% (2359) Culex spp. and 11.6% (2664) Mansonia spp. Screening eaves reduced densities of Anopheles gambiae s. l. (Relative ratio (RR) = 0.91; 95% CI = 0.84, 0.98; P = 0.01); Mansonia africana (RR = 0.43; 95% CI = 0.26, 0.76; P<0.001) and Mansonia uniformis (RR = 0.37; 95% CI = 0.25, 0.56; P<0.001) but not Culex quinquefasciatus, Cx. univittatus or Cx. theileri. Numbers of these species were reduced by screening windows and doors but this was not significant.This study confirms that across Africa, screening eaves protects households against important mosquito vectors of filariasis, Rift Valley Fever and O'Nyong nyong as well as malaria. While full house screening is required to exclude Culex species mosquitoes, screening of eaves alone or fitting ceilings has considerable potential for integrated control of other vectors of filariasis, arbovirus and malaria."
"Journal of virology","Bone marrow stromal antigen 2 (BST-2/tetherin) is a cellular membrane protein that inhibits the release of HIV-1. We show for the first time, using infectious viruses, that BST-2 also inhibits egress of arenaviruses but has no effect on filovirus replication and spread. Specifically, infectious Lassa virus (LASV) release significantly decreased or increased in human cells in which BST-2 was either stably expressed or knocked down, respectively. In contrast, replication and spread of infectious Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV) and Lake Victoria marburgvirus (MARV) were not affected by these conditions. Replication of infectious Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) and cowpox virus (CPXV) was also not affected by BST-2 expression. Elevated cellular levels of human or murine BST-2 inhibited the release of virus-like particles (VLPs) consisting of the matrix proteins of multiple highly virulent NIAID Priority Pathogens, including arenaviruses (LASV and Machupo virus [MACV]), filoviruses (ZEBOV and MARV), and paramyxoviruses (Nipah virus). Although the glycoproteins of filoviruses counteracted the antiviral activity of BST-2 in the context of VLPs, they could not rescue arenaviral (LASV and MACV) VLP release upon BST-2 overexpression. Furthermore, we did not observe colocalization of filoviral glycoproteins with BST-2 during infection with authentic viruses. None of the arenavirus-encoded proteins rescued budding of VLPs in the presence of BST-2. Our results demonstrate that BST-2 might be a broad antiviral factor with the ability to restrict release of a wide variety of human pathogens. However, at least filoviruses, RVFV, and CPXV are immune to its inhibitory effect."
"Bulletin de l'Académie nationale de médecine","Importation of tropical infectious diseases to Europe via animals and animal products. Most emerging and resurgent diseases observed in France in recent decades have been zoonoses, and some have caused unprecedented health crises. The growing international trade in domestic and wild animals and foodstuffs of animal origin is contributing to the emergence or resurgence of such zoonoses, along with accidental or deliberate introduction of certain species into new geographical areas, and the recent craze for exotic pets. Thus, in France, we have witnessed the introduction and sometimes the establishment of new diseases through insect vectors (e.g. bluetongue), foodstuffs of animal origin intended for human or animal consumption (e.g. bovine spongiform encephalopathy and trichinellosis), and diseased or asymptomatically infected animals. This is notably the case of the highly pathogenic influenza virus subtype H5N1 carried by poultry and wild birds, and also pathogens carried by imported pet species (e.g. rabid dogs illegally imported from Morocco, and pet rats infected with cowpox virus). Globalization and global warming will also favor the emergence of new tropical diseases in Europe, and especially African diseases such as Rift Valley fever. Finally, it should be remembered that some diseases with potentially severe economic consequences have disappeared from Europe while remaining active on other continents. This is the case of rinderpest, for example, which led to the creation of the first veterinary school in the world (in Lyon, France) nearly 250 years ago, and which has now been eradicated from Europe."
"PLoS neglected tropical diseases","Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a mosquito-borne viral zoonosis caused by a phlebovirus and transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Humans can also be infected through direct contact with blood (aerosols) or tissues (placenta, stillborn) of infected animals. Although severe clinical cases can be observed, infection with RVF virus (RVFV) in humans is, in most cases, asymptomatic or causes a febrile illness without serious symptoms. In small ruminants RVFV mainly causes abortion and neonatal death. The distribution of RVFV has been well documented in many African countries, particularly in the north (Egypt, Sudan), east (Kenya, Tanzania, Somalia), west (Senegal, Mauritania) and south (South Africa), but also in the Indian Ocean (Madagascar, Mayotte) and the Arabian Peninsula. In contrast, the prevalence of RVFV has rarely been investigated in central African countries.We therefore conducted a large serological survey of rural populations in Gabon, involving 4,323 individuals from 212 randomly selected villages (10.3% of all Gabonese villages). RVFV-specific IgG was found in a total of 145 individuals (3.3%) suggesting the wide circulation of Rift Valley fever virus in Gabon. The seroprevalence was significantly higher in the lakes region than in forest and savannas zones, with respective rates of 8.3%, 2.9% and 2.2%. In the lakes region, RVFV-specific IgG was significantly more prevalent in males than in females (respectively 12.8% and 3.8%) and the seroprevalence increased gradually with age in males but not in females.Although RVFV was suggested to circulate at a relatively high level in Gabon, no outbreaks or even isolated cases have been documented in the country. The higher prevalence in the lakes region is likely to be driven by specific ecologic conditions favorable to certain mosquito vector species. Males may be more at risk of infection than females because they spend more time farming and hunting outside the villages, where they may be more exposed to mosquito bites and infected animals. Further investigations are needed to determine the putative sylvan cycle of RVFV, including the mosquito species and the reservoir role of wild animals in the viral maintenance cycle."
"Journal of virological methods","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is an arthropod-borne pathogen that often results in severe morbidity and mortality in both humans and livestock. As its geographic range continues to expand, it presents a real threat to naïve populations around the world by accidental introduction (e.g., the result of increased travel) or intentional release (e.g., a bioterror event). While there is a clear need for a safe and efficacious vaccine against this emerging and re-emerging pathogen, no FDA-approved vaccine is currently available. This need was addressed by the establishment of novel mammalian and insect suspension cell line systems for the efficient production of RVF virus-like particle (VLP)-based vaccine candidates. A direct comparison of the production of RVF VLPs in these systems was performed. Optimization and characterization resulted in a production platform suitable for scale-up. Furthermore, RVF VLP-based vaccines were tested in a lethal challenge model and showed full protection, demonstrating that RVF VLPs present promising RVFV vaccine candidates.Copyright © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

"Acta tropica","A comparative study between passive and active surveillance based on herd visits (villages) was conducted over a period of 24 months. It included 106 surveillance stations of the animal disease epidemiological surveillance network in Chad distributed randomly into 52 stations of active surveillance and 54 stations of passive surveillance. Nine diseases of various vaccination and expected prevalence status were monitored. The active surveillance stations carried out four herd visits monthly to look for the diseases under surveillance and organised four farmers awareness-raising meetings to stimulate them to make disease notifications. The passive surveillance stations held each month four farmer awareness-raising meetings. The suspicions recorded by the stations were consigned to a suspicion form specific to each disease, indicating whether a call from the farmer, a visit to the herd or a awareness-raising meeting was the source. The results showed that, irrespective of surveillance type, all diseases under surveillance, except the rare diseases (Rinderpest and Rift Valley Fever) were reported by the surveillance agents. However, suspicions recorded following farmer calls are significantly more important than suspicions carried out during herd visits or meetings. Nevertheless, a considerable number of suspicions is recorded during awareness-raising meetings. Finally approximately 83% of the herd visits realised by the active surveillance stations showed negative results (no suspicion identified). Passive surveillance stimulated by awareness-raising meetings appears to be better adapted to Chads conditions and less expensive for the surveillance of existing diseases. However, for the rare diseases, other methods of specific active surveillance (such as for example sentinel herds) remain important to complete passive surveillance.Copyright © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

"Journal of neuroimmune pharmacology : the official journal of the Society on NeuroImmune Pharmacology","Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) are of paramount concern as a group of pathogens at the forefront of emerging and re-emerging diseases. Although some arboviral infections are asymptomatic or present with a mild influenza-like illness, many are important human and veterinary pathogens causing serious illness ranging from rash and arthritis to encephalitis and hemorrhagic fever. Here, we discuss arboviruses from diverse families (Flaviviruses, Alphaviruses, and the Bunyaviridae) that are causative agents of encephalitis in humans. An understanding of the natural history of these infections as well as shared mechanisms of neuroinvasion and neurovirulence is critical to control the spread of these viruses and for the development of effective vaccines and treatment modalities."
"Current opinion in infectious diseases","The purpose was to review recent research on Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) infection, encompassing four main areas: epidemiology and outbreak prediction, viral pathogenesis, human diagnostics and therapeutics, and vaccine and therapeutic candidates.RVFV continues to extend its range in Africa and the Middle East. Better definition of RVFV-related clinical syndromes and human risk factors for severe disease, combined with early-warning systems based on remote-sensing, simplified rapid diagnostics, and tele-epidemiology, hold promise for earlier deployment of effective outbreak control measures. Advances in understanding of viral replication pathways and host cell-related pathogenesis suggest means for antiviral therapeutics and for more effective vaccination strategies based on genetically engineered virus strains or subunit vaccines.RVFV is a significant health and economic burden in many areas of Africa, and remains a serious threat to other parts of the world. Development of more effective methods for RVFV outbreak prevention and control remains a global health priority."
"PLoS neglected tropical diseases","Rift Valley fever (RVF) is an arthropod-borne viral zoonosis. Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is an important biological threat with the potential to spread to new susceptible areas. In addition, it is a potential biowarfare agent.We developed two potential vaccines, DNA plasmids and alphavirus replicons, expressing the Gn glycoprotein of RVFV alone or fused to three copies of complement protein, C3d. Each vaccine was administered to mice in an all DNA, all replicon, or a DNA prime/replicon boost strategy and both the humoral and cellular responses were assessed. DNA plasmids expressing Gn-C3d and alphavirus replicons expressing Gn elicited high titer neutralizing antibodies that were similar to titers elicited by the live-attenuated MP12 virus. Mice vaccinated with an inactivated form of MP12 did elicit high titer antibodies, but these antibodies were unable to neutralize RVFV infection. However, only vaccine strategies incorporating alphavirus replicons elicited cellular responses to Gn. Both vaccines strategies completely prevented weight loss and morbidity and protected against lethal RVFV challenge. Passive transfer of antisera from vaccinated mice into naïve mice showed that both DNA plasmids expressing Gn-C3d and alphavirus replicons expressing Gn elicited antibodies that protected mice as well as sera from mice immunized with MP12.These results show that both DNA plasmids expressing Gn-C3d and alphavirus replicons expressing Gn administered alone or in a DNA prime/replicon boost strategy are effective RVFV vaccines. These vaccine strategies provide safer alternatives to using live-attenuated RVFV vaccines for human use."

"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a negative-sense RNA virus (genus Phlebovirus, family Bunyaviridae) that infects livestock and humans and is endemic to sub-Saharan Africa. Like all negative-sense viruses, the segmented RNA genome of RVFV is encapsidated by a nucleocapsid protein (N). The 1.93-A crystal structure of RVFV N and electron micrographs of ribonucleoprotein (RNP) reveal an encapsidated genome of substantially different organization than in other negative-sense RNA virus families. The RNP polymer, viewed in electron micrographs of both virus RNP and RNP reconstituted from purified N with a defined RNA, has an extended structure without helical symmetry. N-RNA species of approximately 100-kDa apparent molecular weight and heterogeneous composition were obtained by exhaustive ribonuclease treatment of virus RNP, by recombinant expression of N, and by reconstitution from purified N and an RNA oligomer. RNA-free N, obtained by denaturation and refolding, has a novel all-helical fold that is compact and well ordered at both the N and C termini. Unlike N of other negative-sense RNA viruses, RVFV N has no positively charged surface cleft for RNA binding and no protruding termini or loops to stabilize a defined N-RNA oligomer or RNP helix. A potential protein interaction site was identified in a conserved hydrophobic pocket. The nonhelical appearance of phlebovirus RNP, the heterogeneous approximately 100-kDa N-RNA multimer, and the N fold differ substantially from the RNP and N of other negative-sense RNA virus families and provide valuable insights into the structure of the encapsidated phlebovirus genome."
"The open virology journal","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) causes large outbreaks of acute febrile and often fatal illness among humans and domesticated animals in sub-saharan Africa and the Arabian peninsula. RVFV is a member of the family Bunyaviridae, genus Phlebovirus. Like all members of this large virus family, it contains a three-segmented genome of negative/ambisense strand RNA, packaged into viral nucleocapsid protein, and enveloped by a lipid bilayer containing two viral glycoproteins. During the past years, there was an increased interest in RVFV epidemiology, molecular biology, and virulence mechanisms. Here, we will try to provide an overview over the basic features of this significant pathogen, and review the latest developments in this highly active research field."

"Emerging infectious diseases","During 2 successive rainy seasons, January 2008 through May 2008 and November 2008 through March 2009, Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) caused outbreaks in Madagascar. Human and animal infections were confirmed on the northern and southern coasts and in the central highlands. Analysis of partial sequences from RVFV strains showed that all were similar to the strains circulating in Kenya during 2006-2007. A national cross-sectional serologic survey among slaughterhouse workers at high risk showed that RVFV circulation during the 2008 outbreaks included all of the Malagasy regions and that the virus has circulated in at least 92 of Madagascar's 111 districts. To better predict and respond to RVF outbreaks in Madagascar, further epidemiologic studies are needed, such as RVFV complete genome analysis, ruminant movement mapping, and surveillance implementation."
"Journal of the Egyptian Society of Parasitology","In this study, 2654 adults and mosquito larvae, which belong to 18 species and 4 genera, were collected: Aedes (2 spp.), Anopheles (7 spp.), Culex (8 spp.) and Culiseta (1 sp.). They were Aedes caspius, Ae. aegypti, Anopheles. azaniae, An. d'thali, An. multicolor, An. rhodesiensis, An. stephensi, An.

A total of 2270 mosquito larvae were collected, and Culex spp. were the most abundant, where 1629 (71.76%) larvae were collected, followed by 499 (21.98%) Anopheles spp., 94 (4.14%) Aedes spp. and 48 (2.12%) Culiseta longiareolata. Of, 384 adult mosquitoes collected Culex spp. were the most abundant and 328 (85.42%) were collected, followed by 22 (5.73%) Aedes spp., 19 (4.94%) Anopheles spp. and 15 (3.91%) Culiseta longiareolata. The physical properties of the water in the breeding sites of mosquito larvae showed that pH of water varied between 6.9 & 9.9, the total dissolved salts (TDS) varied between 378-9504 ppm and water temperature varied between 8.7 degrees C in winter to 29.9 degrees C in summer. There was no correlation between pH & TDS of water in breeding site and distribution of larvae. The population density started to increase in March, with a peak in August when temperature was 36 degress C. The activity started to decrease in October, and minimum activity was in January, when temperature was below 5 degrees C. The seasonal abundance of adult mosquitoes was not affected by rainfall. A. aegypti, vector of Dengue fever virus, Cx. tritaeniorhynchus, vector of Rift Valley fever and Cx. univittatus, vector of sindbis virus were reported for the first time in Al Madinah Al Munawwrah Region. These vectors constituted a major health problem, and every effort should be made for feasible control."
"Médecine tropicale : revue du Corps de santé colonial","Rift valley fever (RVF) is a viral zoonosis that can also infect humans. Haemorrhagic RVF is a severe potentially fatal form of the disease. Although haemorrhagic RVF accounts for only 1% of all infections, death occurs in up to 5% of cases. The purpose of this report is describe a severe case of haemorrhagic RVF observed in a 22-year-old cattle breeder admitted to the intensive care units of the Joseph Raseta Befelatanana University Hospitals in Antananarivo. The disease presented as an infectious syndrome but hemorrhagic manifestations developed early (day 2). They consisted of diffuse haemorrhage events (haemorrhagic vomit, gingival haemorrhage, skin haemorrhage, urinary haemorrhage, and haemorrhage on the venous puncture site). In spite of intensive care, haemorrhagic complications lead to death on day 4 of clinical evolution. Laboratory findings demonstrated alteration in liver function and coagulation disturbances. Multiple organ failure was also observed."

"Epidemiology and infection","Since Kenya first reported Rift Valley fever (RVF)-like disease in livestock in 1912, the country has reported the most frequent epizootics of RVF disease. To determine the pattern of disease spread across the country after its introduction in 1912, and to identify regions vulnerable to the periodic epizootics, annual livestock disease records at the Department of Veterinary Services from 1910 to 2007 were analysed in order to document the number and location of RVF-infected livestock herds. A total of 38/69 (55%) administrative districts in the country had reported RVF epizootics by the end of 2007. During the 1912-1950 period, the disease was confined to a district in Rift Valley province that is prone to flooding and where livestock were raised in proximity with wildlife. Between 1951 and 2007, 11 national RVF epizootics were recorded with an average inter-epizootic period of 3·6 years (range 1-7 years); in addition, all epizootics occurred in years when the average annual rainfall increased by more than 50% in the affected districts. Whereas the first two national epizootics in 1951 and 1955 were confined to eight districts in the Rift Valley province, there was a sustained epizootic between 1961 and 1964 that spread the virus to over 30% of the districts across six out of eight provinces. The Western and Nyanza provinces, located on the southwestern region of the country, had never reported RVF infections by 2007. The probability of a district being involved in a national epizootic was fivefold higher (62%) in districts that had previously reported disease compared to districts that had no prior disease activity (11%). These findings suggests that once introduced into certain permissive ecologies, the RVF virus becomes enzootic, making the region vulnerable to periodic epizootics that were probably precipitated by amplification of resident virus associated with heavy rainfall and flooding."
"Vaccine","The efficacy and safety of the naturally attenuated Rift Valley Fever (RVF) Clone 13 vaccine were evaluated in ovines in three different experiments involving 38 ewes at different stages of pregnancy, their offsprings and four rams. In Experiment 1, 4 rams and a total of 13 pregnant ewes were vaccinated and monitored during vaccination and after a challenge with a virulent RVF virus. The ewes were vaccinated at either 50 or 100 days of pregnancy and some were challenged after lambing. In Experiment 2, nine oestrus-synchronized ewes were vaccinated at 50 days of pregnancy and challenged at 100 days of pregnancy together with 5 unvaccinated ewes at the same stage of pregnancy. In Experiment 3, 16 oestrus-synchronized ewes were vaccinated with 3 different doses of the RVF Clone 13 vaccine and challenged together with unvaccinated pregnant ewes at either 30 or 50 days of pregnancy. The results from the three experiments indicated that the vaccine did not induce clinical manifestation of RVF such as abortion in pregnant ewes, teratogeny in their offsprings, or pyrexia in all vaccinated animals. Vaccination with RVF Clone 13 vaccine also prevented clinical RVF following virulent challenge at different stages of pregnancy while unvaccinated control ewes showed pyrexia, aborted or died of RVF. A vaccine dose-response effect was also observed.(c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
"Virology journal","Since the first isolation of the Rift Valley Fever virus (RVFV) in 1930s, there have been several epizootics outbreaks in the tropic mainly in Africa including Sudan. Recognition of cases and diagnosis of RVF are critical for management and control of the disease.To investigate the seroprevalence and risk factors for seropositive to RVFV IgG among febrile patients.All febrile patients presented to New Halfa hospital in eastern Sudan during September through November 2007 were investigated to identify the cause of their fever including malaria and RFV.Out of 290 feverish patients presented to the hospital, malaria was diagnosis in 94 individuals. Fevers of unknown origin were diagnosed in 149 patients. Seropositive to RVFV IgG was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 122 (81.8%) of the sera from these 149 patients with fever of unknown origin. While socio-demographic characteristics (age, Job, education and residency) were not associated with seropositive to RVFV IgG, male (OR = 2.8, 95% CI = 1.0-7.6; P = 0.04) were at three times higher risk for seropositive to RVFV IgG.There was a high seropositive to RVFV IgG in this setting, more research is needed perhaps using other methods like PCR and IGM."
"Revue scientifique et technique (International Office of Epizootics)","Panzootics such as highly pathogenic avian influenza and Rift Valley fever have originated from the South, largely among poor communities. On a global level, approximately two-thirds of those individuals living on less than US$2 per day keep livestock. Consequently, there is a need to better target animal health interventions for poverty reduction using an evidence-based approach. Therefore, the paper offers a three-step prioritisation framework using calculations derived from standard poverty measures: the poverty gap and the head count ratio. Data from 265 poor livestock-keeping households in Kenya informed the study. The results demonstrate that, across a spectrum of producers, the dependence upon particular species varies. Furthermore, the same livestock disease has differing impacts on the depth and severity of poverty. Consequently, animal health interventions need to account for variability in income effects at the species and disease levels."
"Vaccine","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) causes recurrent large outbreaks among humans and livestock. Although the virus is currently confined to the African continent and the Arabian Peninsula, there is a growing concern for RVFV incursions into countries with immunologically naïve populations. The RVFV structural glycoproteins Gn and Gc are preferred targets in the development of subunit vaccines that can be used to control future outbreaks. We here report the production of Gn and Gc by a recombinant vaccine strain of the avian paramyxovirus Newcastle disease virus (NDV) and demonstrate that intramuscular vaccination with this experimental NDV-based vector vaccine provides complete protection in mice. We also demonstrate that a single intramuscular vaccination of lambs, the main target species of RVFV, is sufficient to elicit a neutralizing antibody response."
"American journal of veterinary research","To evaluate the prevalence of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) antibodies in livestock and presence of competent mosquito vectors of RVFV during an interepizootic period (IEP) in Kenya.208 sheep and 84 goats ranging in age from 4 months to 15 years, from 2 breeding herds.Blood specimens were collected from the sheep and goats during the 1999-2006 IEP in Rift Valley Province, and serum was harvested. Serum specimens were tested for IgG and IgM antibodies against RVFV by use of an ELISA. In addition, 7,134 mosquitoes were trapped in Naivasha, Nairobi, and Northeastern Province, and speciation was performed.No animals were seropositive for IgM against RVFV. Of the animals born after the 1997-1998 epizootic, 18% (34/188) of sheep were seropositive for IgG against RVFV, compared with 3% (2/75) of goats. Seventy percent (8,144/11,678) of the mosquitoes collected were of the Culex subgenera; 18% (2,102/11,678) were Aedes spp.Detection of IgG in the sera of sheep and goats born after the 1997-1998 epizootic and before the 2006 epizootic indicated that virus activity existed during the IEP. Detection of Aedes mosquitoes, which are competent vectors of RVFV, suggested that a cryptic vector-to-vertebrate cycle may exist during IEPs."
"Human vaccines","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is an arthropod-borne pathogen that often results in severe morbidity and mortality in both humans and livestock. As its geographic range continues to spread, it presents a real threat to naïve populations around the world by accidental introduction (e.g., the result of increased world travel) or a bioterror event. The lack of prophylactic and therapeutic measures, the potential for human-to-human transmission, and the significant threat to livestock associated with RVFV make infection with these pathogens a serious public health concern. Rift Valley fever epizootics and epidemics might rapidly overwhelm the capacities of the public health and veterinary medical communities to provide rapid diagnostic testing, distribution of countermeasures and adequate medical care."
"Middle East African journal of ophthalmology","Infectious causes should always be considered in all patients with uveitis and it should be ruled out first. The differential diagnosis includes multiple well-known diseases including herpes, syphilis, toxoplasmosis, tuberculosis, bartonellosis, Lyme disease, and others. However, clinicians should be aware of emerging infectious agents as potential causes of systemic illness and also intraocular inflammation. Air travel, immigration, and globalization of business have overturned traditional pattern of geographic distribution of infectious diseases, and therefore one should work locally but think globally, though it is not possible always. This review recapitulates the systemic and ocular mainfestations of several emergent infectious diseases relevant to the ophthalmologist including Rickettsioses, West Nile virus infection, Rift valley fever, dengue fever, and chikungunya. Retinitis, chorioretinitis, retinal vasculitis, and optic nerve involvement have been associated with these emergent infectious diseases. The diagnosis of any of these infections is usually based on pattern of uveitis, systemic symptoms and signs, and specific epidemiological data and confirmed by detection of specific antibody in serum. A systematic ocular examination, showing fairly typical fundus findings, may help in establishing an early clinical diagnosis, which allows prompt, appropriate management."

"Euro surveillance : bulletin Européen sur les maladies transmissibles = European communicable disease bulletin","Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a severe mosquito-borne disease affecting humans and domestic ruminants, caused by a Phlebovirus (Bunyaviridae). It is widespread in Africa and has recently spread to Yemen and Saudi Arabia. RVF epidemics are more and more frequent in Africa and the Middle East, probably in relation with climatic changes (episodes of heavy rainfall in eastern and southern Africa), as well as intensified livestock trade. The probability of introduction and large-scale spread of RVF in Europe is very low, but localized RVF outbreaks may occur in humid areas with a large population of ruminants. Should this happen, human cases would probably occur in exposed individuals: farmers, veterinarians, slaughterhouse employees etc. Surveillance and diagnostic methods are available, but control tools are limited: vector control is difficult to implement, and vaccines are only available for ruminants, with either a limited efficacy (inactivated vaccines) or a residual pathogenic effect. The best strategy to protect Europe and the rest of the world against RVF is to develop more efficient surveillance and control tools and to implement coordinated regional monitoring and control programmes."
"mAbs","This paper describes the generation of monoclonal antibodies directed to immunogenic nucleoprotein N epitopes of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), and their application in diagnostics, both for antibody detection in competitive ELISA and for antigen capture in a sandwich ELISA. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were generated after DNA immunization of Balb/c mice and characterized by western blot, ELISA and cell immunostaining assays. At least three different immunorelevant epitopes were defined by mAb competition assays. Interestingly, two of the mAbs generated were able to distinguish between RVFV strains from Egyptian or South African lineages. These monoclonal antibodies constitute useful tools for diagnosis, especially for the detection of serum anti-RVFV antibodies from a broad range of species by means of competitive ELISA."
"Parasites & vectors","Arboviruses are transmitted in nature exclusively or to a major extend by arthropods. They belong to the most important viruses invading new areas in the world and their occurrence is strongly influenced by climatic changes due to the life cycle of the transmitting vectors. Several arboviruses have emerged in new regions of the world during the last years, like West Nile virus (WNV) in the Americas, Usutu virus (USUV) in Central Europe, or Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) in the Arabian Peninsula. In most instances the ways of introduction of arboviruses into new regions are not known. Infections acquired during stays in the tropics and subtropics are diagnosed with increasing frequency in travellers returning from tropical countries, but interestingly no attention is paid on accompanying pet animals or the hematophagous ectoparasites that may still be attached to them. Here we outline the known ecology of the mosquito-borne equine encephalitis viruses (WEEV, EEEV, and VEEV), WNV, USUV, RVFV, and Japanese Encephalitis virus, as well as Tick-Borne Encephalitis virus and its North American counterpart Powassan virus, and will discuss the most likely mode that these viruses could expand their respective geographical range. All these viruses have a different epidemiology as different vector species, reservoir hosts and virus types have adapted to promiscuous and robust or rather very fine-balanced transmission cycles. Consequently, these viruses will behave differently with regard to the requirements needed to establish new endemic foci outside their original geographical ranges. Hence, emphasis is given on animal trade and suitable ecologic conditions, including competent vectors and vertebrate hosts."
"PloS one","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), a member of the genus Phlebovirus within the family Bunyaviridae, is a negative-stranded RNA virus with a tripartite genome. RVFV is transmitted by mosquitoes and causes fever and severe hemorrhagic illness among humans, while in livestock it causes fever and high abortion rates.Sequence analysis showed that a wild-type RVFV ZH501 preparation consisted of two major viral subpopulations, with a single nucleotide heterogeneity at nucleotide 847 of M segment (M847); one had a G residue at M847 encoding glycine in a major viral envelope Gn protein, while the other carried A residue encoding glutamic acid at the corresponding site. Two ZH501-derived viruses, rZH501-M847-G and rZH501-M847-A, carried identical genomic sequences, except that the former and the latter had G and A, respectively, at M847 were recovered by using a reverse genetics system. Intraperitoneal inoculation of rZH501-M847-A into mice caused a rapid and efficient viral accumulation in the sera, livers, spleens, kidneys and brains, and killed most of the mice within 8 days, whereas rZH501-M847-G caused low viremia titers, did not replicate as efficiently as did rZH501-M847-A in these organs, and had attenuated virulence to mice. Remarkably, as early as 2 days postinfection with rZH501-M847-G, the viruses carrying A at M847 emerged and became the major virus population thereafter, while replicating viruses retained the input A residue at M847 in rZH501-M847-A-infected mice.These data demonstrated that the single nucleotide substitution in the Gn protein substantially affected the RVFV mouse virulence and that a virus population carrying the virulent viral genotype quickly emerged and became the major viral population within a few days in mice that were inoculated with the attenuated virus."
"ILAR journal / National Research Council, Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources","An avian influenza outbreak in 2002 affected 197 poultry farms in Virginia and cost an estimated $130 million in losses and cleanup. In 2004-2005, researchers initiated a project to investigate the feasibility and practicality of in-house composting of turkey mortalities (heavy hens and toms) as a method of disposal and disease containment. Occurrences of low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) in West Virginia and Virginia in 2007 provided an opportunity for first responders to verify composting as an effective carcass disposal method. Many lessons learned from these experiences have led to improvements in the application of this technology. Market-weight turkeys, once thought too large for effective composting, were composted sufficiently for land application within 4 to 6 weeks. Additionally, fire-fighting foam, a new method of mass depopulation, proved to be compatible with composting. Knowledge gained from these incidents will be valuable not only for future responses to LPAI but also for outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza such as the H5N1 virus, which currently causes disease in both animals and humans in many parts of the world. Since three-quarters of all recent emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) have arisen from animals, control of disease in animals is the principal way to reduce human exposure and prevent EIDs. Many of the general approaches and specific techniques used to eradicate the avian influenza virus can also be used to control other EIDs such as H1N1, Nipah virus, Rift Valley Fever, and plague."
"BMC infectious diseases","Rift Valley fever (RVF) is an acute febrile arthropod-borne viral disease of man and animals caused by a member of the Phlebovirus genus, one of the five genera in the family Bunyaviridae. RVF virus (RVFV) is transmitted between animals and human by mosquitoes, particularly those belonging to the Culex, Anopheles and Aedes genera.Experiments were designed during RVF outbreak, 2007 in Sudan to provide an answer about many raised questions about the estimated role of vector in RVFV epidemiology. During this study, adult and immature mosquito species were collected from Khartoum and White Nile states, identified and species abundance was calculated. All samples were frozen individually for further virus detection. Total RNA was extracted from individual insects and RVF virus was detected from Culex, Anopheles and Aedes species using RT-PCR. In addition, data were collected about human cases up to November 24th, 2007 to asses the situation of the disease in affected states. Furthermore, a historical background of the RVF outbreaks was discussed in relation to global climatic anomalies and incriminated vector species.A total of 978 mosquitoes, belonging to 3 genera and 7 species, were collected during Sudan outbreak, 2007. Anopheles gambiae arabiensis was the most frequent species (80.7%) in White Nile state. Meanwhile, Cx. pipiens complex was the most abundant species (91.2%) in Khartoum state. RT-PCR was used and successfully amplified 551 bp within the M segment of the tripartite negative-sense single stranded RNA genome of RVFV. The virus was detected in female, male and larval stages of Culex and Anopheles species. The most affected human age interval was 15-29 years old followed by > or = 45 years old, 30-44 years old, and then 5-14 years old. Regarding to the profession, housewives followed by farmers, students, shepherd, workers and the free were more vulnerable to the infection. Furthermore, connection between human and entomological studies results in important human case-vulnerability relatedness findings.Model performance, integrated with epidemiologic and environmental surveillance systems should be assessed systematically for RVF and other mosquito-borne diseases using historical epidemiologic and satellite monitoring data. Case management related interventions; health education and vector control efforts are extremely effective in preparedness for viral hemorrhagic fever and other seasonal outbreaks."
"The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene","Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus is an emerging pathogen that is transmitted in many regions of sub-Saharan Africa, parts of Egypt, and the Arabian peninsula. Outbreaks of RVF, like other diseases caused by hemorrhagic fever viruses, typically present in locations with very limited health resources, where initial diagnosis must be based only on history and physical examination. Although general signs and symptoms of human RVF have been documented, a specific clinical syndrome has not been described. In 2007, a Kenyan outbreak of RVF provided opportunity to assess acutely ill RVF patients and better delineate its presentation and clinical course. Our data reveal an identifiable clinical syndrome suggestive of severe RVF, characterized by fever, large-joint arthralgia, and gastrointestinal complaints and later followed by jaundice, right upper-quadrant pain, and delirium, often coinciding with hemorrhagic manifestations. Further characterization of a distinct RVF clinical syndrome will aid earlier detection of RVF outbreaks and should allow more rapid implementation of control."

"The Journal of experimental biology","Vector-borne pathogens cause enormous suffering to humans and animals. Many are expanding their range into new areas. Dengue, West Nile and Chikungunya have recently caused substantial human epidemics. Arthropod-borne animal diseases like Bluetongue, Rift Valley fever and African horse sickness pose substantial threats to livestock economies around the world. Climate change can impact the vector-borne disease epidemiology. Changes in climate will influence arthropod vectors, their life cycles and life histories, resulting in changes in both vector and pathogen distribution and changes in the ability of arthropods to transmit pathogens. Climate can affect the way pathogens interact with both the arthropod vector and the human or animal host. Predicting and mitigating the effects of future changes in the environment like climate change on the complex arthropod-pathogen-host epidemiological cycle requires understanding of a variety of complex mechanisms from the molecular to the population level. Although there has been substantial progress on many fronts the challenges to effectively understand and mitigate the impact of potential changes in the environment on vector-borne pathogens are formidable and at an early stage of development. The challenges will be explored using several arthropod-borne pathogen systems as illustration, and potential avenues to meet the challenges will be presented."
"Insect biochemistry and molecular biology","Resistance to insecticides was monitored on Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus mosquitoes collected in twelve localities of La Réunion, a geographically isolated island of the Indian Ocean. This mosquito is of medical concern in the region as a known vector for filariasis and a potential vector for West Nile and Rift Valley Fever viruses. Our bioassays indicated the presence of resistance to all tested insecticides, i.e. organochlorides, organophosphates and pyrethroids. A molecular investigation revealed a higher frequency of resistance genes in the coastal areas compared to elevated rural sites, probably reflecting the different nature of insecticide pressures together with the genetic cost of resistance alleles. A simple molecular test was developed to detect Rdl allele, encoding a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor resistant to dieldrin. Unexpectedly high Rdl frequencies were recorded over the whole island, despite this insecticide having been banned for over 15 years. This resistant allele was also detected for the first time in two samples of Aedes albopictus, a species recently involved in severe Chikungunya epidemics on the island. Rdl selection in these two mosquito species discloses current insecticide pressures in urban areas, from unknown origins, that should be taken into account to develop vector control strategies.Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

"Vaccine","In this work, plasmid constructs encoding two different M segment ORFs, as well as the nucleoprotein N, have been used in different vaccination regimes to test protection against a RVFV-MP12 virus challenge in a transgenic mouse model with impaired interferon type I response (IFNAR(-/-)). We obtained dose dependent protection in animals immunized with a construct encoding both mature glycoproteins (pCMV-M4), whereas only partial protection in animals vaccinated with either N construct (pCMV-N) or a combination of both plasmids (pCMV-M4+pCMV-N). The protection elicited by the expression of the mature glycoproteins could be directly related to the induction of neutralizing antibodies against them. Interestingly, the combination of both vaccine constructs induced specific lymphoblast proliferation upon stimulation with a recombinant nucleoprotein.Copyright 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

"Virology journal","Studies of the host response to infection often require quantitative measurement of the antiviral type I interferons (IFN-alpha/beta) in biological samples. The amount of IFN is either determined via its ability to suppress a sensitive indicator virus, by an IFN-responding reporter cell line, or by ELISA. These assays however are either time-consuming and lack convenient readouts, or they are rather insensitive and restricted to IFN from a particular host species.An IFN-sensitive, Renilla luciferase-expressing Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV-Ren) was generated using reverse genetics. Human, murine and avian cells were tested for their susceptibility to RVFV-Ren after treatment with species-specific IFNs. RVFV-Ren was able to infect cells of all three species, and IFN-mediated inhibition of viral reporter activity occurred in a dose-dependent manner. The sensitivity limit was found to be 1 U/ml IFN, and comparison with a standard curve allowed to determine the activity of an unknown sample.RVFV-Ren replicates in cells of several species and is highly sensitive to pre-treatment with IFN. These properties allowed the development of a rapid, sensitive, and species-independent antiviral assay with a convenient luciferase-based readout."
"Viruses","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a human and livestock pathogen endemic to sub-Saharan Africa. We have developed a T7-dependent system for the efficient production of RVFV-like particles (RVF-VLPs) based on the virulent ZH-501 strain of RVFV. The RVF-VLPs are capable of performing a single round of infection, allowing for the study of viral replication, assembly, and infectivity. We demonstrate that these RVF-VLPs are antigenically indistinguishable from authentic RVFV and respond similarly to a wide array of known and previously unknown chemical inhibitors. This system should be useful for screening for small molecule inhibitors of RVFV replication."
"Veterinary journal (London, England : 1997)","This study, carried out between September 2006 and January 2007, is the first cross-sectional serological investigation of peste-des-petits-ruminants (PPR) and Rift Valley fever (RVF) in Tunisia. The objective was to assess the potential need to develop a dual, recombinant PPR-RVF vaccine and how such a vaccine might be utilised in Tunisia. An overall PPR seroprevalence of 7.45% was determined, a finding supported by the high specificity (99.4%) and sensitivity (94.5%) of the ELISA used. On assessment of the diversity and density of mosquitoes in the sampling area, four species of RVF-vectors of the genus Aedes and Culex were identified. However, no serological evidence of RVF was found despite the use of a highly sensitive ELISA (99-100%). Larger scale investigations are underway to confirm these findings and the continuation of the emergency vaccination program against these two diseases remains valid.Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","We describe an antiviral small molecule, LJ001, effective against numerous enveloped viruses including Influenza A, filoviruses, poxviruses, arenaviruses, bunyaviruses, paramyxoviruses, flaviviruses, and HIV-1. In sharp contrast, the compound had no effect on the infection of nonenveloped viruses. In vitro and in vivo assays showed no overt toxicity. LJ001 specifically intercalated into viral membranes, irreversibly inactivated virions while leaving functionally intact envelope proteins, and inhibited viral entry at a step after virus binding but before virus-cell fusion. LJ001 pretreatment also prevented virus-induced mortality from Ebola and Rift Valley fever viruses. Structure-activity relationship analyses of LJ001, a rhodanine derivative, implicated both the polar and nonpolar ends of LJ001 in its antiviral activity. LJ001 specifically inhibited virus-cell but not cell-cell fusion, and further studies with lipid biosynthesis inhibitors indicated that LJ001 exploits the therapeutic window that exists between static viral membranes and biogenic cellular membranes with reparative capacity. In sum, our data reveal a class of broad-spectrum antivirals effective against enveloped viruses that target the viral lipid membrane and compromises its ability to mediate virus-cell fusion."

"Viruses","Arboviruses are maintained in a natural cycle that requires blood-sucking arthropod and vertebrate hosts. Arboviruses are believed to persistently infect their arthropod host without overt pathology and cause acute infection with viremia in their vertebrate host. We have focused on elucidating how a specific arbovirus, Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus, causes cytopathic effect in cells derived from vertebrates and non-cytopathic infection in cells derived from arthropods. We demonstrate that the vertebrate virulence factor, NSs, is functional in arthropod cells but is expressed at significantly lower levels in infected arthropod versus infected vertebrate cells."
"Veterinary pathology","With few exceptions, the diseases that present the greatest risk to food animal production have been largely similar throughout the modern era of veterinary medicine. The current trend regarding the ever-increasing globalization of the trade of animals and animal products ensures that agricultural diseases will continue to follow legal and illegal trade patterns with increasing rapidity. Global climate changes have already had profound effects on the distribution of animal diseases, and it is an inevitable reality that continually evolving climatic parameters will further transform the ecology of numerous pathogens. In recent years, many agricultural diseases have given cause for concern regarding changes in distribution or severity. Foot-and-mouth disease, avian influenza, and African swine fever continue to cause serious problems. The expected announcement of the global eradication of rinderpest is one of the greatest successes of veterinary preventative medicine, yet the closely related disease peste des petits ruminants still spreads throughout the Middle East and Asia. The spread of novel strains of bluetongue virus across Europe is an ominous indicator that climate change is sure to influence trends in movement of agricultural diseases. Overall, veterinary practitioners and investigators are advised to not only maintain vigilance against the staple disease threats but to always be sufficiently broad-minded to expect the unexpected."
"Vaccine","In the past decade, the use of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) as a vaccine vector for the prevention of economically important livestock diseases as well as for human diseases has been extensively explored. In this study, we have constructed a recombinant NDV vaccine virus, named NDFL-Gn, that produces the Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) Gn glycoprotein. Calves were immunized via either the intranasal route or the intramuscular route. Delivery via the intranasal route elicited no detectable antibody responses, whereas delivery via the intramuscular route elicited antibodies against both NDV and the Gn protein. The RVFV-neutralizing activity of the antisera from intramuscularly vaccinated calves was demonstrated, suggesting that NDV is a promising vaccine vector for the prevention of RVF in calves.Copyright 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

"Vaccine","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is an emerging mosquito-borne virus causing significant morbidity and mortality in livestock and humans. Rift Valley fever is endemic in Africa, but also outside this continent outbreaks have been reported. Here we report the evaluation of two vaccine candidates based on the viral Gn and Gc envelope glycoproteins, both produced in a Drosophila insect cell expression system. Virus-like particles (VLPs) were generated by merely expressing the Gn and Gc glycoproteins. In addition, a soluble form of the Gn ectodomain was expressed and affinity-purified from the insect cell culture supernatant. Both vaccine candidates fully protected mice from a lethal challenge with RVFV. Importantly, absence of the nucleocapsid protein in either vaccine candidate facilitates the differentiation between infected and vaccinated animals using a commercial recombinant nucleocapsid protein-based indirect ELISA.Copyright 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

"Global health action","Climate and environment vary across many spatio-temporal scales, including the concept of climate change, which impact on ecosystems, vector-borne diseases and public health worldwide.To develop a conceptual approach by mapping climatic and environmental conditions from space and studying their linkages with Rift Valley Fever (RVF) epidemics in Senegal.Ponds in which mosquitoes could thrive were identified from remote sensing using high-resolution SPOT-5 satellite images. Additional data on pond dynamics and rainfall events (obtained from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission) were combined with hydrological in-situ data. Localisation of vulnerable hosts such as penned cattle (from QuickBird satellite) were also used.Dynamic spatio-temporal distribution of Aedes vexans density (one of the main RVF vectors) is based on the total rainfall amount and ponds' dynamics. While Zones Potentially Occupied by Mosquitoes are mapped, detailed risk areas, i.e. zones where hazards and vulnerability occur, are expressed in percentages of areas where cattle are potentially exposed to mosquitoes' bites.This new conceptual approach, using precise remote-sensing techniques, simply relies upon rainfall distribution also evaluated from space. It is meant to contribute to the implementation of operational early warning systems for RVF based on both natural and anthropogenic climatic and environmental changes. In a climate change context, this approach could also be applied to other vector-borne diseases and places worldwide."
"Emerging health threats journal","Emerging infectious diseases (EID) are currently the major threat to public health worldwide and most EID events have involved zoonotic infectious agents. Central Africa in general and Gabon in particular are privileged areas for the emergence of zoonotic EIDs. Indeed, human incursions in Gabonese forests for exploitation purposes lead to intensified contacts between humans and wildlife thus generating an increased risk of emergence of zoonotic diseases. In Gabon, 51 endemic or potential endemic viral infectious diseases have been reported. Among them, 22 are of zoonotic origin and involve 12 families of viruses. The most notorious are dengue, yellow fever, ebola, marburg, Rift Valley fever and chikungunya viruses. Potential EID due to wildlife in Gabon are thereby plentiful and need to be inventoried. The Gabonese Public Health system covers geographically most of the country allowing a good access to sanitary information and efficient monitoring of emerging diseases. However, access to treatment and prevention is better in urban areas where medical structures are more developed and financial means are concentrated even though the population is equally distributed between urban and rural areas. In spite of this, Gabon could be a good field for investigating the emergence or re-emergence of zoonotic EID. Indeed Gabonese health research structures such as CIRMF, advantageously located, offer high quality researchers and facilities that study pathogens and wildlife ecology, aiming toward a better understanding of the contact and transmission mechanisms of new pathogens from wildlife to human, the emergence of zoonotic EID and the breaking of species barriers by pathogens."

"Parasites & vectors","This study reports for the first time on the distribution, host preference and infection rates of malaria vectors in Mauritania. It was conducted during an outbreak of Rift valley fever. Three anopheline species were reported. An. arabiensis was the predominant species observed in all regions whereas An. pharoensis and An. funestus were observed along the south border in the Senegal River valley where extensive irrigation schemes are present. The distribution limits of anopheline species were observed from the Senegal River basin in the Trarza region up to the south limit of the Saharan desert in Tidjikja city. Overall, all An. funestus and An. pharoensis were fed respectively on human and ovine hosts whereas the mean anthropophilic rate of An. gambiae s.l. was 53%. A low Plasmodium falciparum infection rate was observed for species of the An. gambiae complex (0.17%) represented mainly by An. arabiensis. Because of the specific nature of this investigation, longitudinal studies are essential to better characterize the malaria vectors and their respective role in malaria transmission."

"Virology","Virus-like particles (VLPs) present viral antigens in a native conformation and are effectively recognized by the immune system and therefore are considered as suitable and safe vaccine candidates against many viral diseases. Here we demonstrate that chimeric VLPs containing Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) glycoproteins G(N) and G(C), nucleoprotein N and the gag protein of Moloney murine leukemia virus represent an effective vaccine candidate against Rift Valley fever, a deadly disease in humans and livestock. Long-lasting humoral and cellular immune responses are demonstrated in a mouse model by the analysis of neutralizing antibody titers and cytokine secretion profiles. Vaccine efficacy studies were performed in mouse and rat lethal challenge models resulting in high protection rates. Taken together, these results demonstrate that replication-incompetent chimeric RVF VLPs are an efficient RVFV vaccine candidate.Copyright 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
"Journal of virology","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is an emerging, highly pathogenic virus; RVFV infection can lead to encephalitis, retinitis, or fatal hepatitis associated with hemorrhagic fever in humans, as well as death, abortions, and fetal deformities in animals. RVFV nonstructural NSs protein, a major factor of the virulence, forms filamentous structures in the nuclei of infected cells. In order to further understand RVFV pathology, we investigated, by chromatin immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and confocal microscopy, the capacity of NSs to interact with the host genome. Our results demonstrate that even though cellular DNA is predominantly excluded from NSs filaments, NSs interacts with some specific DNA regions of the host genome such as clusters of pericentromeric gamma-satellite sequence. Targeting of these sequences by NSs was correlated with the induction of chromosome cohesion and segregation defects in RVFV-infected murine, as well as sheep cells. Using recombinant nonpathogenic virus rZHDeltaNSs210-230, expressing a NSs protein deleted of its region of interaction with cellular factor SAP30, we showed that the NSs-SAP30 interaction was essential for NSs to target pericentromeric sequences, as well as for induction of chromosome segregation defects. The effect of RVFV upon the inheritance of genetic information is discussed with respect to the pathology associated with fetal deformities and abortions, highlighting the main role played by cellular cofactor SAP30 on the establishment of NSs interactions with host DNA sequences and RVFV pathogenesis."
"The Journal of the Egyptian Public Health Association","This study was carried out to clarify the possible role of pigs as intermediate host for Rift Valley Fever (RVF) virus through detection of antibodies to RVF in the sera of pigs and human contacts. Two hundreds and forty five of pig blood samples and forty three blood samples of human contacts to the pigs (Veterinarian and their assistants, butchers and Abattoir workers) were collected from pigs' abattoir at Alexandria governorate, Egypt. Blood samples were subjected to the detection of RVF antibodies by both ELISA and HAI techniques. The detection rate of RVF antibodies in pig sera by ELISA was 37 positive (15.1%) out of 245 tested sera samples. The highest detection rate of positive samples was in winter season (12 out of 58, (20.69%) and the lowest detection rate was at summer season (7 out of 70, (10.0%), while it was 9 (15.79%) and 9 (15.0%) positive out of 57 and 60 tested sera samples in spring and autumn seasons respectively with no significant differences between them. When HAI technique was applied to detect the RVF antibodies in pig sera, it gave only 20 positive samples out of 245 (8.16%) with highest detection rate was also in winter 7 (12.07%) while it was only 1 (1.43%) in summer season with significant differences between the results obtained in the summer season and those of autumn and winter seasons. History was taken from all of human contacts to exclude the possibilities of taking neither vaccination nor infection from other sources. The detection rates of antibodies against RVF virus in human contacts were 6 (13.95%) and 3 (6.98%) by ELISA and HAI techniques respectively. Our study does not exclude that, pigs act as a possible intermediate host in the maintenance cycle of RVF virus."
"Saudi journal of kidney diseases and transplantation : an official publication of the Saudi Center for Organ Transplantation, Saudi Arabia","Renal impairment is a frequent occurrence among patients with the Rift Valley fever (RVF), and is probably the result of hypovolemia and multiple organ dysfunctions in the majority of cases. This study was conducted to estimate the incidence of renal impairment in patients with RVF as well as to determine the associated mortality. Data of all patients admitted with renal impairment to the Gezira Hospital for Renal Diseases, Sudan, during the epidemic of RVF between September 2007 and January 2008 were analyzed. The total number of patients with RVF was 392 of whom, 194 were admitted to the Medani Teaching Hospital. Renal impairment was detected in 60% of the admitted patients; 90% of them needed dialysis treatment. The mortality rate was 31% in patients with acute renal failure, 25% in those with the hepatorenal syndrome and 31% in patients with primary hepatic involvement and mild renal impairment. The overall mortality was 40%. Our study suggests that RVF remains a major cause of acute renal failure with considerable mortality, although progression to chronic renal failure was not seen. Early renal substitution therapy fosters the best hope for survival."
"Antiviral research","Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) are important causes of human disease nearly worldwide. All arboviruses circulate among wild animals, and many cause disease after spillover transmission to humans and agriculturally important domestic animals that are incidental or dead-end hosts. Viruses such as dengue (DENV) and chikungunya (CHIKV) that have lost the requirement for enzootic amplification now produce extensive epidemics in tropical urban centers. Many arboviruses recently have increased in importance as human and veterinary pathogens using a variety of mechanisms. Beginning in 1999, West Nile virus (WNV) underwent a dramatic geographic expansion into the Americas. High amplification associated with avian virulence coupled with adaptation for replication at higher temperatures in mosquito vectors, has caused the largest epidemic of arboviral encephalitis ever reported in the Americas. Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), the most frequent arboviral cause of encephalitis worldwide, has spread throughout most of Asia and as far south as Australia from its putative origin in Indonesia and Malaysia. JEV has caused major epidemics as it invaded new areas, often enabled by rice culture and amplification in domesticated swine. Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), another arbovirus that infects humans after amplification in domesticated animals, undergoes epizootic transmission during wet years following droughts. Warming of the Indian Ocean, linked to the El Niño-Southern Oscillation in the Pacific, leads to heavy rainfall in east Africa inundating surface pools and vertically infected mosquito eggs laid during previous seasons. Like WNV, JEV and RVFV could become epizootic and epidemic in the Americas if introduced unintentionally via commerce or intentionally for nefarious purposes. Climate warming also could facilitate the expansion of the distributions of many arboviruses, as documented for bluetongue viruses (BTV), major pathogens of ruminants. BTV, especially BTV-8, invaded Europe after climate warming and enabled the major midge vector to expand is distribution northward into southern Europe, extending the transmission season and vectorial capacity of local midge species. Perhaps the greatest health risk of arboviral emergence comes from extensive tropical urbanization and the colonization of this expanding habitat by the highly anthropophilic (attracted to humans) mosquito, Aedes aegypti. These factors led to the emergence of permanent endemic cycles of urban DENV and CHIKV, as well as seasonal interhuman transmission of yellow fever virus. The recent invasion into the Americas, Europe and Africa by Aedes albopictus, an important CHIKV and secondary DENV vector, could enhance urban transmission of these viruses in tropical as well as temperate regions. The minimal requirements for sustained endemic arbovirus transmission, adequate human viremia and vector competence of Ae. aegypti and/or Ae. albopictus, may be met by two other viruses with the potential to become major human pathogens: Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, already an important cause of neurological disease in humans and equids throughout the Americas, and Mayaro virus, a close relative of CHIKV that produces a comparably debilitating arthralgic disease in South America. Further research is needed to understand the potential of these and other arboviruses to emerge in the future, invade new geographic areas, and become important public and veterinary health problems.Copyright 2009 Elsevier B.V.

"Vaccine","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), which belongs to the genus Phlebovirus, family Bunyaviridae, is a negative-stranded RNA virus carrying a tripartite RNA genome. RVFV is transmitted by mosquitoes and causes large outbreaks among ruminants and humans in Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. Human patients develop an acute febrile illness, followed by a fatal hemorrhagic fever, encephalitis or ocular diseases, whereas ruminants experience abortions during outbreak. Effective vaccination of both humans and ruminants is the best approach to control Rift Valley fever. This article summarizes the development of inactivated RVFV vaccine, live attenuated vaccine, and other new generation vaccines."
"Journal of virology","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) (genus Phlebovirus, family Bunyaviridae) causes mosquito-borne epidemic diseases in humans and livestock. The virus carries three RNA segments, L, M, and S, of negative or ambisense polarity. L protein, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, encoded in the L segment, and N protein, encoded in the S segment, exert viral RNA replication and transcription. Coexpression of N, hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged L, and viral minigenome resulted in minigenome replication and transcription, a finding that demonstrated HA-tagged L was biologically active. Likewise L tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP) was biologically competent. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis using extracts from cells coexpressing HA-tagged L and GFP-tagged L showed the formation of an L oligomer. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation analysis and coimmunoprecipitation studies demonstrated the formation of an intermolecular L-L interaction through its N-terminal and C-terminal regions and also suggested an intramolecular association between the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of L protein. A biologically inactive L mutant, in which the conserved signature SDD motif was replaced by the amino acid residues GNN, exhibited a dominant negative phenotype when coexpressed with wild-type L in the minigenome assay system. Expression of this mutant L also inhibited viral gene expression in virus-infected cells. These data provided compelling evidence for the importance of oligomerization of RVFV L protein for its polymerase activity."
"Virology","The Adames strain of Punta Toro virus (PTV-A, Bunyaviridae, Phlebovirus) causes an acute lethal disease in hamsters and mice. The Balliet strain of the virus (PTV-B) is generally considered to be avirulent. The difference in hamster susceptibility is likely due to the ability of PTV-A to suppress interferon (IFN)-beta similarly to that described for Rift Valley fever virus. Here we investigated strain differences in PTV pathogenesis and the IFN response in mice. Although PTV-B infection in mice did not induce systemic IFN-beta release, primary macrophages produced dramatically higher levels when exposed to the virus in culture. The importance of IFN in resistance to PTV infection was borne out in studies employing STAT-1 knock-out mice. Also, a number of genes specific to IFN response pathways were upregulated in PTV-B-infected macrophages. Our findings provide new insights into the type I IFN response during PTV infection in the mouse model of phleboviral disease."
"Clinical and vaccine immunology : CVI","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) has been cited as a potential biological-weapon threat due to the serious and fatal disease it causes in humans and animals and the fact that this mosquito-borne virus can be lethal in an aerosolized form. Current human and veterinary vaccines against RVFV, however, are outdated, inefficient, and unsafe. We have incorporated the RVFV glycoprotein genes into a nonreplicating complex adenovirus (CAdVax) vector platform to develop a novel RVFV vaccine. Mice vaccinated with the CAdVax-based vaccine produced potent humoral immune responses and were protected against lethal RVFV infection. Additionally, protection was elicited in mice despite preexisting immunity to the adenovirus vector."
"Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), which belongs to the genus Phlebovirus, family Bunyaviridae, is a negative-stranded RNA virus carrying a single-stranded, tripartite RNA genome. RVFV is an important zoonotic pathogen transmitted by mosquitoes and causes large outbreaks among ruminants and humans in Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. Human patients develop an acute febrile illness, followed by a fatal hemorrhagic fever, encephalitis, or ocular diseases. A viral nonstructural protein, NSs, is a major viral virulence factor. Past studies showed that NSs suppresses the transcription of host mRNAs, including interferon-beta mRNAs. Here we demonstrated that the NSs protein induced post-transcriptional downregulation of dsRNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR), to prevent phosphorylation of eIF2alpha and promoted viral translation in infected cells. These two biological activities of the NSs most probably have a synergistic effect in suppressing host innate immune functions and facilitate efficient viral replication in infected mammalian hosts."
"Verhandelingen - Koninklijke Academie voor Geneeskunde van België","Viruses have learned to multiply in the face of a powerful innate and adaptive immune response of the host. They have evolved multiple strategies to evade the interferon (IFN) system which would otherwise limit virus growth at an early stage of infection. IFNs induce the synthesis of a range of antiviral proteins which serve as cell-autonomous intrinsic restriction factors. For example, the dynamin-like MxA GTPase inhibits the multiplication of influenza and bunyaviruses (such as La Crosse virus, Hantaan virus, Rift Valley Fever virus, and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus) by binding and sequestering the nucleocapsid protein into large perinuclear complexes. To overcome such intracellular restrictions, virulent viruses either inhibit IFN synthesis, bind and inactivate secreted IFN molecules, block IFN-activated signaling, or disturb the action of IFN-induced antiviral proteins. Many viruses produce specialized proteins to disarm the danger signal or express virulence genes that target members of the IFN regulatory factor family (IRFs) or components of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. An alternative evasion strategy is based on extreme viral replication speed which out-competes the IFN response. The identification of viral proteins with IFN antagonistic functions has great implications for disease prevention and therapy. Virus mutants lacking IFN antagonistic properties represent safe yet highly immunogenic candidate vaccines. Furthermore, novel drugs intercepting viral IFN-antagonists could be used to disarm the viral intruders."
"Médecine tropicale : revue du Corps de santé colonial","Rift Valley fever (RVF) is an arboviral zoonosis affecting a wide range of animal species as well as humans. Clinical incidence in domestic ruminants is high with infection causing abortions in pregnant animals and high mortality rates in newborns. In humans, clinical disease appears in about 50% of infected individuals. Human illness is characterized by dengue-like symptoms with severe complications including encephalitis, retinitis, hemorrhagic fever and death occurring in 1 to 3% of cases. During epidemic outbreaks, transmission between animals or from animals to humans is mainly by direct contact with infected biological material. Under these conditions, mosquito transmission probably plays a greater role in maintaining the enzootic cycle and initiating epizootic and epidemic outbreaks during the periods of heavy rainfall. The last epidemic outbreak of RVF in Kenya, Somalia, Tanzania and Sudan in 2006-2007 killed more than 4,000 ruminants and 600 humans. After confirmed diagnosis of one human case in 2007 in Comoros, an epidemiological survey was carried out in ruminant livestock in Mayotte. Results indicated that the RVF virus has been circulating on the island since 2005. In addition, serum samples collected from patients presenting dengue-like symptoms confirmed approximately 10 cases of human infection in 2007-2008. These results suggest low-level circulation of the RVF virus in Mayotte with weak impact on human and animal health. An assessment of future risk for the island is presented."
"Travel medicine and infectious disease","While an increased risk of hepatitis is associated with travel, the risk of hepatitis associated with the Islamic Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia has not been carefully quantified. Conditions unique to this gathering can pose the risk of both enteral and parenteral viral hepatitis. During this congregation, pilgrims stay in tents shared by 100 or more people often living on foods from street vendors and sharing common toilet facilities that can expose them to both hepatitis A and E. To mark the end of the festival, head shaving or trimming by fellow pilgrims or street barbers, who often re-use their razor may expose them to hepatitis B or C. Pilgrims are also at risk of cuts to the hands and feet while sacrificing cattle and walking barefooted, which may further increase the risk of parenteral viral hepatitis. Emerging diseases such as Alkhumra virus and Rift Valley fever, which may cause hepatitis, are also potentially important for the Hajj pilgrims. Improved health education to increase awareness about the risk of these diseases and appropriate immunisations, particularly hepatitis A and B vaccines, could play an important role."
"International ophthalmology","In any patient with uveitis, an infectious cause should be ruled out first. The differential diagnosis includes multiple well-known diseases including herpes, syphilis, toxoplasmosis, tuberculosis, bartonellosis, Lyme disease, and others. However, clinician should be aware of emerging infectious agents as potential causes of systemic illness and also intraocular inflammation. Air travel, immigration, and globalization of business have overturned traditional pattern of geographic distribution of infectious diseases, and therefore one should work locally but think globally. This review recapitulates the systemic and ocular manifestations of several emergent infectious diseases relevant to the ophthalmologist including Rickettsioses, West Nile virus infection, Rift valley fever, Dengue fever, and Chikungunya. Retinitis, chorioretinitis, retinal vasculitis, and optic nerve involvement have been associated with these emergent infectious diseases. The diagnosis of any of these infections is usually based on pattern of uveitis, systemic symptoms and signs, and specific epidemiological data and confirmed by detection of specific antibody in serum. A systematic ocular examination, showing fairly typical fundus findings, may help establish an early clinical diagnosis, which allows prompt, appropriate management."
"Médecine tropicale : revue du Corps de santé colonial","Several viruses now circulating in tropical zones around the globe are potential threats for ever-increasing human populations even in temperate zones that have long remained unaffected. The mechanisms underlying transport and transmission, which can be enhanced by human activity, can be even stronger in zones where factors needed to support development of these viruses, i.e., hosts, reservoirs and vectors, are already present. This possibility has been illustrated by dengue virus, and now by the rapid spread of the Chikungunya virus on Reunion Island in 2005 and then in Italy in 2007. The spreading of Chikungunya virus despite its mild reputation had a major unexpected impact. It showed that the evolution of the virus, whether a cause or consequence of observed events, could be determinant. The risk of extension of more pathogenic viruses due to similar mechanisms must be considered as a possibility. In this regard the Rift Valley fever virus, that already involves a large area and has a major reservoir, is one of the viruses that deserves close surveillance."
"Antiviral research","The advent of reverse genetics technology has revolutionized the study of RNA viruses, making it possible to manipulate their genomes and evaluate the effects of these changes on their biology and pathogenesis. The fundamental insights gleaned from reverse genetics-based studies over the last several years provide a new momentum for the development of designed therapies for the control and prevention of these viral pathogens. This review summarizes the successes and stumbling blocks in the development of reverse genetics technologies for Rift Valley fever virus and their application to the further dissection of its pathogenesis and the design of new therapeutics and safe and effective vaccines."
"Virology journal","Rift Valley Fever Virus is a pathogen of humans and livestock that causes significant morbidity and mortality throughout Africa and the Middle East. A vaccine that would protect animals from disease would be very beneficial to the human population because prevention of the amplification cycle in livestock would greatly reduce the risk of human infection by preventing livestock epizootics. A mutant virus, constructed through the use of reverse genetics, is protective in laboratory animal models and thus shows promise as a potential vaccine. However, the ability to distinguish infected from vaccinated animals is important for vaccine acceptance by national and international authorities, given regulations restricting movement and export of infected animals.In this study, we describe the development of a simple assay that can be used to distinguish naturally infected animals from ones that have been vaccinated with a mutant virus. We describe the cloning, expression and purification of two viral proteins, and the development of side by side ELISAs using the two viral proteins.A side by side ELISA can be used to differentiate infected from vaccinated animals. This assay can be done without the use of biocontainment facilities and has potential for use in both human and animal populations."
"Journal of medical entomology","Mosquitoes collected during an outbreak of Rift Valley fever in Kenya from December 2006 to February 2007 were tested to isolate other mosquito-borne arboviruses circulating in the region. Twenty-seven virus isolations were made comprising seven viruses from three arbovirus families."
"Epidemiology and infection","Expert opinion was elicited to undertake a qualitative risk assessment to estimate the current and future risks to the European Union (EU) from five vector-borne viruses listed by the World Organization for Animal Health. It was predicted that climate change will increase the risk of incursions of African horse sickness virus (AHSV), Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) and Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) into the EU from other parts of the world, with African swine fever virus (ASFV) and West Nile virus (WNV) being less affected. Currently the predicted risks of incursion were lowest for RVFV and highest for ASFV. Risks of incursion were considered for six routes of entry (namely vectors, livestock, meat products, wildlife, pets and people). Climate change was predicted to increase the risk of incursion from entry of vectors for all five viruses to some degree, the strongest effects being predicted for AHSV, CCHFV and WNV. This work will facilitate identification of appropriate risk management options in relation to adaptations to climate change."
"Virology journal","RVF live attenuated vaccine (Smithburn strain) was evaluated by using goats as experimental animal. The results indicate that this vaccine cause severe deleterious pathological changes in liver especially in kids and causing abortion in pregnant does. The virus was seen to be propagated inside hepatic cells forming intranuclear inclusions which was also seen by E.M. Viral antigens were detected in hepatic cells, gall bladder, endothelial lining of blood vessels, leukocytes, kidneys and heart by using immunoflourescent technique. It could be concluded that the use of live attenuated vaccine of RVF (Smithburn strain) for immunization of live stock is not safe in Egypt as it considered an endemic area."

"Transboundary and emerging diseases","Rift Valley fever (RVF) is an expanding zoonotic disease transmitted from ruminant to ruminant by Culicidae mosquitoes. In 2004, a longitudinal serological survey was performed on small ruminants in the Ferlo are (Senegal) to study RVF transmission and compared the results with those obtained from the same study in 2003. The results confirm that the disease is endemic and that the spatial transmission of RVF is highly heterogeneous. The virus could be maintained during dry season by transovarian transmission in Aedes vexans. Further studies are needed to improve the understanding of the epidemiological cycle of RVF in this region to implement adapted surveillance measures."
"Antiviral research","We report herein the identification of a small molecule therapeutic, FGI-106, which displays potent and broad-spectrum inhibition of lethal viral hemorrhagic fevers pathogens, including Ebola, Rift Valley and Dengue Fever viruses, in cell-based assays. Using mouse models of Ebola virus, we further demonstrate that FGI-106 can protect animals from an otherwise lethal infection when used either in a prophylactic or therapeutic setting. A single treatment, administered 1 day after infection, is sufficient to protect animals from lethal Ebola virus challenge. Cell-based assays also identified inhibitory activity against divergent virus families, which supports a hypothesis that FGI-106 interferes with a common pathway utilized by different viruses. These findings suggest FGI-106 may provide an opportunity for targeting viral diseases."
"Journal of virological methods","The aim of this study was to design and construct a non-virulent simulant to replace several pathogenic viruses in the development of detection and identification methods in biodefense. A non-infectious simulant was designed and engineered to include the nucleic acid signature of VEEV (Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis virus), Influenza virus, Rift Valley Fever virus, Machupo virus, Lassa virus, Yellow Fever virus, Ebola virus, Eastern Equine Encephalitis virus, Junin virus, Marburg virus, Dengue virus, and Crimean-Congo virus, all in a single construct. The nucleic acid sequences of all isolates available for each virus species were aligned using ClustalW software in order to obtain conserved regions of the viral genomes. Specific primers were designed to permit the identification and differentiation between viral threat agents. A chimera of 3143 base pairs was engineered to produce 13 PCR amplicons of different sizes. PCR amplification of the simulant with virus-specific primers revealed products of the predicted length, in bands of similar intensity, and without detectable unspecific products by electrophoresis analysis. The simulant described could reduce the need to use infectious viruses in the development of detection and diagnostic methods, and could also be useful as a non-virulent positive control in nucleic acid-based tests against biological threat agents."
"Geospatial health","This paper presents an analysis of the interaction between the various variables associated with Rift Valley fever (RVF) such as the mosquito vector, available hosts and rainfall distribution. To that end, the varying zones potentially occupied by mosquitoes (ZPOM), rainfall events and pond dynamics, and the associated exposure of hosts to the RVF virus by Aedes vexans, were analyzed in the Barkedji area of the Ferlo, Senegal, during the 2003 rainy season. Ponds were identified by remote sensing using a high-resolution SPOT-5 satellite image. Additional data on ponds and rainfall events from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission were combined with in-situ entomological and limnimetric measurements, and the localization of vulnerable ruminant hosts (data derived from QuickBird satellite). Since ""Ae. vexans productive events"" are dependent on the timing of rainfall for their embryogenesis (six days without rain are necessary to trigger hatching), the dynamic spatio-temporal distribution of Ae. vexans density was based on the total rainfall amount and pond dynamics. Detailed ZPOM mapping was obtained on a daily basis and combined with aggressiveness temporal profiles. Risks zones, i.e. zones where hazards and vulnerability are combined, are expressed by the percentages of parks where animals are potentially exposed to mosquito bites. This new approach, simply relying upon rainfall distribution evaluated from space, is meant to contribute to the implementation of a new, operational early warning system for RVF based on environmental risks linked to climatic and environmental conditions."
"Journal of wildlife diseases","We investigated the relationship between prevalence and severity of clinical signs of Demodex cafferi infection in free-ranging African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) and other factors such as age, sex, pregnancy status, and concomitant infections with bovine tuberculosis (BTB), Rift Valley fever (RVF), and brucellosis (BA). Approximately half of 203 buffalo examined in this study had clinical signs of demodicosis (cutaneous nodules); younger age classes had the highest prevalence and severity of lesions (chi(2)=21.4, df=6, P=0.0015). Nodules were generally limited to the head and neck region, but in severe cases were present over the entire animal. We found no significant association between clinical severity of the Demodex infection and gender, pregnancy status, or infection with BTB, RVF, or BA."
"Preventive veterinary medicine","This paper describes the sensitivity and specificity of a commercial competitive ELISA for the detection of antibodies to Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) from sera of French domestic ruminants. Field samples were collected from mainland France for the known-negative sera (cattle=191, goats=119, sheep=192) and from ruminants of a French overseas territory (Mayotte) for the known-positive sera. A cut-off value of 43% was determined for all species, achieving a sensitivity and specificity of 100% and a concordance of 100% with the species-specific threshold recommended by the manufacturer. Our results demonstrate that this ELISA may be a suitable diagnostic tool for disease surveillance programmes and import/export veterinary certification of French cattle, goats and sheep."
"Euro surveillance : bulletin Européen sur les maladies transmissibles = European communicable disease bulletin","Arboviruses are arthropod-borne viruses, which include West Nile fever virus (WNFV), a mosquito-borne virus, Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), a mosquito-borne virus, and Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), a tick-borne virus. These arthropod-borne viruses can cause disease in different domestic and wild animals and in humans, posing a threat to public health because of their epidemic and zoonotic potential. In recent decades, the geographical distribution of these diseases has expanded. Outbreaks of WNF have already occurred in Europe, especially in the Mediterranean basin. Moreover, CCHF is endemic in many European countries and serious outbreaks have occurred, particularly in the Balkans, Turkey and Southern Federal Districts of Russia. In 2000, RVF was reported for the first time outside the African continent, with cases being confirmed in Saudi Arabia and Yemen. This spread was probably caused by ruminant trade and highlights that there is a threat of expansion of the virus into other parts of Asia and Europe. In the light of global warming and globalisation of trade and travel, public interest in emerging zoonotic diseases has increased. This is especially evident regarding the geographical spread of vector-borne diseases. A multi-disciplinary approach is now imperative, and groups need to collaborate in an integrated manner that includes vector control, vaccination programmes, improved therapy strategies, diagnostic tools and surveillance, public awareness, capacity building and improvement of infrastructure in endemic regions."

"Virology","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV; Bunyaviridae; Phlebovirus) is an emerging human and veterinary pathogen causing acute hepatitis in ruminants and has the potential to cause hemorrhagic fever in humans. We report a three-dimensional reconstruction of RVFV vaccine strain MP-12 (RVFV MP-12) by cryo-electron microcopy using icosahedral symmetry of individual virions. Although the genomic core of RVFV MP-12 is apparently poorly ordered, the glycoproteins on the virus surface are highly symmetric and arranged on a T=12 icosahedral lattice. Our RVFV MP-12 structure allowed clear identification of inter-capsomer contacts and definition of possible glycoprotein arrangements within capsomers. This structure provides a detailed model for phleboviruses, opens new avenues for high-resolution structural studies of the bunyavirus family, and aids the design of antiviral diagnostics and effective subunit vaccines."
"Journal of virology","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) continues to cause large outbreaks of acute febrile and often fatal illness among humans and domesticated animals in Africa, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen. The high pathogenicity of this bunyavirus is mainly due to the viral protein NSs, which was shown to prevent transcriptional induction of the antivirally active type I interferons (alpha/beta interferon [IFN-alpha/beta]). Viruses lacking the NSs gene induce synthesis of IFNs and are therefore attenuated, whereas the noninducing wild-type RVFV strains can only be inhibited by pretreatment with IFN. We demonstrate here in vitro and in vivo that a substantial part of the antiviral activity of IFN against RVFV is due to a double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR). PKR-mediated virus inhibition, however, was much more pronounced for the strain Clone 13 with NSs deleted than for the NSs-expressing strain ZH548. In vivo, Clone 13 was nonpathogenic for wild-type (wt) mice but could regain pathogenicity if mice lacked the PKR gene. ZH548, in contrast, killed both wt and PKR knockout mice indiscriminately. ZH548 was largely resistant to the antiviral properties of PKR because RVFV NSs triggered the specific degradation of PKR via the proteasome. The NSs proteins of the related but less virulent sandfly fever Sicilian virus and La Crosse virus, in contrast, had no such anti-PKR activity despite being efficient suppressors of IFN induction. Our data suggest that RVFV NSs has gained an additional anti-IFN function that may explain the extraordinary pathogenicity of this virus."
"PLoS pathogens","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) (genus Phlebovirus, family Bunyaviridae) is a negative-stranded RNA virus with a tripartite genome. RVFV is transmitted by mosquitoes and causes fever and severe hemorrhagic illness among humans, and fever and high rates of abortions in livestock. A nonstructural RVFV NSs protein inhibits the transcription of host mRNAs, including interferon-beta mRNA, and is a major virulence factor. The present study explored a novel function of the RVFV NSs protein by testing the replication of RVFV lacking the NSs gene in the presence of actinomycin D (ActD) or alpha-amanitin, both of which served as a surrogate of the host mRNA synthesis suppression function of the NSs. In the presence of the host-transcriptional inhibitors, the replication of RVFV lacking the NSs protein, but not that carrying NSs, induced double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR)-mediated eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF)2alpha phosphorylation, leading to the suppression of host and viral protein translation. RVFV NSs promoted post-transcriptional downregulation of PKR early in the course of the infection and suppressed the phosphorylated eIF2alpha accumulation. These data suggested that a combination of RVFV replication and NSs-induced host transcriptional suppression induces PKR-mediated eIF2alpha phosphorylation, while the NSs facilitates efficient viral translation by downregulating PKR and inhibiting PKR-mediated eIF2alpha phosphorylation. Thus, the two distinct functions of the NSs, i.e., the suppression of host transcription, including that of type I interferon mRNAs, and the downregulation of PKR, work together to prevent host innate antiviral functions, allowing efficient replication and survival of RVFV in infected mammalian hosts."
"Journal of virology","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a member of the genus Phlebovirus within the family Bunyaviridae. It is a mosquito-borne zoonotic agent that can cause hemorrhagic fever in humans. The enveloped RVFV virions are known to be covered by capsomers of the glycoproteins G(N) and G(C), organized on a T=12 icosahedral lattice. However, the structural units forming the RVFV capsomers have not been determined. Conflicting biochemical results for another phlebovirus (Uukuniemi virus) have indicated the existence of either G(N) and G(C) homodimers or G(N)-G(C) heterodimers in virions. Here, we have studied the structure of RVFV using electron cryo-microscopy combined with three-dimensional reconstruction and single-particle averaging. The reconstruction at 2.2-nm resolution revealed the organization of the glycoprotein shell, the lipid bilayer, and a layer of ribonucleoprotein (RNP). Five- and six-coordinated capsomers are formed by the same basic structural unit. Molecular-mass measurements suggest a G(N)-G(C) heterodimer as the most likely candidate for this structural unit. Both leaflets of the lipid bilayer were discernible, and the glycoprotein transmembrane densities were seen to modulate the curvature of the lipid bilayer. RNP densities were situated directly underneath the transmembrane densities, suggesting an interaction between the glycoprotein cytoplasmic tails and the RNPs. The success of the single-particle averaging approach taken in this study suggests that it is applicable in the study of other phleboviruses, as well, enabling higher-resolution description of these medically important pathogens."
"Bulletin de la Société de pathologie exotique (1990)","Rift Valley Fever (RVF) and West Nile fever (WN) viruses are transmitted by several mosquito species and share the same vectors in Northern Senegal (West Africa). In absence of an effective treatment and vaccines, vector control remains an alternative method of prevention and control of these vector-borne diseases. The methods targeting adults' pest mosquitoes and malaria vectors which are currently used by the population in the Barkedji area (insecticides treated nets, bombs and copper coil) would not be effective against these vectors because of their exophagic and zoophilic behavior. Thus, we decided to evaluate the effectiveness of insecticide-treated cattle as a method to control these vectors. We evaluated the effects of this treatment on the mortality and the behaviour (attractiveness and engorgement) of the main vectors and subsidiary the whole mosquito fauna. Our study was conducted during September 2005, and between July and November 2006, at Niakha pond located 4 km from the Barkedji village in the Sahelian region of Senegal. A bull-calf was treated with 25 mg/m2 of deltamethrin and compared to an untreated calf of the same weight used as a control. The assays were conducted using two net-traps placed at the edge of the pond from 19:00 PM to 22:00 PM each night for 4 nights per week for 4 consecutive weeks after each treatment. The risk that host- seeking mosquitoes that do not have possibility to feed on cattle might turn to men cohabiting with these cattle was evaluated simultaneously during the bioassay. The deltamethrin treatment led to a significant reduction in the average number of mosquitoes attracted by the treated-calf compared to the control during the first 2 weeks post-treatment both for all species and for the main vectors such as Ae. vexans, Ae. ochraceus, Cx. poicilipes, Cx. neavei and Ma. uniformis. However these means were comparable for the last two weeks post-treatment both for the whole mosquito fauna and the main vectors with the exception of Cx. neavei. The treatment resulted in a significant reduction in the rates of engorged females during the first two weeks post-treatment. Indeed, the females' engorgement rate on the treated-calf compared to the control has been reduced by 57.3% for Ae. vexans, 39.8% for Ae. ochraceus, 76.4% for Cx. poicilipes, 82.4% for Cx. neavei, 84.6% for Ma. uniformis and 64.1% for the whole mosquito fauna. This effect of the treatment was maintained in the second fortnight post-treatment only for Cx. neavei. Mortality rates were higher among mosquitoes collected with the treated-calf compared to the control in the first fortnight of the test. This impact of the insecticide has been maintained in the second fortnight post-treatment excepted for Cx. neavei. However a significant variation of the mortality of the mosquitoes collected with the treated-cattle was observed between the two fortnights. In fact, the mortality rate of the mosquitoes collected on the treated-cattle decreased by 43.8% for the mosquito fauna as a whole, 47.5% for Cx. poicilipes and 82.4% for Ae. vexans, 76% for Ae. ochraceus, and 63.3% for Ma. uniformis. No deviation of host-seeking mosquitoes, from treated calf to men, has been observed since the average number of host-seeking mosquitoes collected on men close to the two calves was statistically comparable. The insecticide-treated cattle may be a good method for controlling RVF and WN vectors and associated mosquitoes in Senegal. However there is a need to develop new formulations or new strategies of application that could improve the duration of the effectiveness of the treatment."
"Journal of the American Mosquito Control Association","The rapid spread of West Nile viral activity across North America since its discovery in 1999 illustrates the potential for an exotic arbovirus to be introduced and widely established across North America. Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) has been responsible for large outbreaks in Africa that have resulted in hundreds of thousands of human infections and major economic disruption due to loss of livestock and to trade restrictions. However, little is known about the potential for North American mosquitoes to transmit this virus should it be introduced into North America. Therefore, we evaluated selected mosquito species from the southeastern United States for their ability to serve as potential vectors for RVFV. Mosquitoes were fed on adult hamsters inoculated 1 day previously with RVFV. These mosquitoes were tested for infection and ability to transmit RVFV after incubation at 26 degrees C for 7-21 days. None of the species tested (Aedes taeniorhynchus, Ae. vexans, Culex erraticus, Cx. nigripalpus, Cx. quinquefasciatus, and Cx. salinarius) were efficient vectors after they fed on hamsters with viremias ranging from 10(4.1) to 10(6.9) plaque-forming units (PFU)/ml. However, Ae. taeniorhynchus, Ae. vexans, and Cx. erraticus all developed disseminated infections after they fed on hamsters with viremias between 10(8.5) and 10(10.2) PFU/ml, and both Ae. vexans and Cx. erraticus transmitted RVFV by bite. These studies illustrate the need to identify the ability of individual mosquito species to transmit RVFV so that appropriate decisions can be made concerning the application of control measures during an outbreak."
"Journal of clinical microbiology","Approximately 8% of Rift Valley fever (RVF) cases develop severe disease, leading to hemorrhage, hepatitis, and/or encephalitis and resulting in up to 50% of deaths. A major obstacle in the management of RVF and other viral hemorrhagic fever cases in outbreaks that occur in rural settings is the inability to rapidly identify such cases, with poor prognosis early enough to allow for more-aggressive therapies. During an RVF outbreak in Kenya in 2006 to 2007, we evaluated whether quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) could be used in the field to rapidly identify viremic RVF cases with risk of death. In 52 of 430 RVF cases analyzed by qRT-PCR and virus culture, 18 died (case fatality rate [CFR] = 34.6%). Levels of viremia in fatal cases were significantly higher than those in nonfatal cases (mean of 10(5.2) versus 10(2.9) per ml; P < 0.005). A negative correlation between the levels of infectious virus particles and the qRT-PCR crossover threshold (C(T)) values allowed the use of qRT-PCR to assess prognosis. The CFR was 50.0% among cases with C(T) values of <27.0 (corresponding to 2.1 x 10(4) viral RNA particles/ml of serum) and 4.5% among cases with C(T) values of >or=27.0. This cutoff yielded 93.8% sensitivity and a 95.5% negative predictive value; the specificity and positive predictive value were 58% and 50%, respectively. This study shows a correlation between high viremia and fatality and indicates that qRT-PCR testing can identify nearly all fatal RVF cases."
"Epidemiology and infection","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a mosquito-transmitted bunyavirus (genus Phlebovirus) associated with severe disease in livestock and fatal encephalitis or haemorrhagic fever in a proportion of infected humans. Although live attenuated and inactivated vaccines have been used in livestock, and on a limited scale in humans, there is a need for improved anti-RVFV vaccines. Towards this goal, Sindbis virus replicon vectors expressing the RVFV Gn and Gc glycoproteins, as well as the non-structural nsM protein, were constructed and evaluated for their ability to induce protective immune responses against RVFV. These replicon vectors were shown to produce the RVFV glycoproteins to high levels in vitro and to induce systemic anti-RVFV antibody responses in immunized mice, as determined by RVFV-specific ELISA, fluorescent antibody tests, and demonstration of a neutralizing antibody response. Replicon vaccination also provided 100% protection against lethal RVFV challenge by either the intraperitoneal or intranasal route. Furthermore, preliminary results indicate that the replicon vectors elicit RVFV-specific neutralizing antibody responses in vaccinated sheep. These results suggest that alphavirus-based replicon vectors can induce protective immunity against RVFV, and that this approach merits further investigation into its potential utility as a RVFV vaccine."
"Virology","Rift Valley Fever virus (RVFV) regularly accounts for severe and often lethal outbreaks among livestock and humans in Africa. Safe and effective veterinarian and human vaccines are highly needed. We present evidence that administration of RVF virus-like particles (VLPs) induces protective immunity in mice. In an accompanying paper, (Habjan, M., Penski, N., Wagner, V., Spiegel, M., Overby, A.K., Kochs, G., Huiskonen, J., Weber, F., 2009. Efficient production of Rift Valley fever virus-like particles: the antiviral protein MxA can inhibit primary transcription of Bunyaviruses. Virology 385, 400-408) we report the production of these VLPs in mammalian cells. After three subsequent immunizations with 1x10(6) VLPs/dose, high titers of virus-neutralizing antibodies were detected; 11 out of 12 mice were protected from challenge and only 1 out of 12 mice survived infection in the control groups. VLP vaccination efficiently suppressed replication of the challenge virus, whereas in the control animals high RNA levels and increasing antibody titers against the nucleocapsid protein indicated extensive viral replication. Our study demonstrates that the RVF VLPs are highly immunogenic and confer protection against RVFV infection in mice. In the test groups, the vaccinated mice did not exhibit any side effects, and the lack of anti-nucleocapsid protein antibodies serologically distinguished vaccinated animals from experimentally infected animals."
"Virology","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a highly pathogenic member of the family Bunyaviridae that needs to be handled under biosafety level (BSL) 3 conditions. Here, we describe reverse genetics systems to measure RVFV polymerase activity in mammalian cells and to generate virus-like particles (VLPs). Recombinant polymerase (L) and nucleocapsid protein (N), expressed together with a minireplicon RNA, formed transcriptionally active nucleocapsids. These could be packaged into VLPs by additional expression of viral glycoproteins. The VLPs resembled authentic virus particles and were able to infect new cells. After infection, VLP-associated nucleocapsids autonomously performed primary transcription, and co-expression of L and N in VLP-infected cells allowed subsequent replication and secondary transcription. Bunyaviruses are potently inhibited by a human interferon-induced protein, MxA. However, the affected step in the infection cycle is not entirely characterized. Using the VLP system, we demonstrate that MxA inhibits both primary and secondary transcriptions of RVFV. A set of infection assays distinguishing between virus attachment, entry, and subsequent RNA synthesis confirmed that MxA is able to target immediate early RNA synthesis of incoming RVFV particles. Thus, our reverse genetics systems are useful for dissecting individual steps of RVFV infection under non-BSL3 conditions."
"Virology journal","Affecting both livestock and humans, Rift Valley Fever is considered as one of the most important viral zoonoses in Africa. However, no licensed vaccines or effective treatments are yet available for human use. Naked DNA vaccines are an interesting approach since the virus is highly infectious and existing attenuated Rift Valley Fever virus vaccine strains display adverse effects in animal trials. In this study, gene-gun immunisations with cDNA encoding structural proteins of the Rift Valley Fever virus were evaluated in mice. The induced immune responses were analysed for the ability to protect mice against virus challenge.Immunisation with cDNA encoding the nucleocapsid protein induced strong humoral and lymphocyte proliferative immune responses, and virus neutralising antibodies were acquired after vaccination with cDNA encoding the glycoproteins. Even though complete protection was not achieved by genetic immunisation, four out of eight, and five out of eight mice vaccinated with cDNA encoding the nucleocapsid protein or the glycoproteins, respectively, displayed no clinical signs of infection after challenge. In contrast, all fourteen control animals displayed clinical manifestations of Rift Valley Fever after challenge.The appearance of Rift Valley Fever associated clinical signs were significantly decreased among the DNA vaccinated mice and further adjustment of this strategy may result in full protection against Rift Valley Fever."
"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","El Niño/Southern Oscillation related climate anomalies were analyzed by using a combination of satellite measurements of elevated sea-surface temperatures and subsequent elevated rainfall and satellite-derived normalized difference vegetation index data. A Rift Valley fever (RVF) risk mapping model using these climate data predicted areas where outbreaks of RVF in humans and animals were expected and occurred in the Horn of Africa from December 2006 to May 2007. The predictions were subsequently confirmed by entomological and epidemiological field investigations of virus activity in the areas identified as at risk. Accurate spatial and temporal predictions of disease activity, as it occurred first in southern Somalia and then through much of Kenya before affecting northern Tanzania, provided a 2 to 6 week period of warning for the Horn of Africa that facilitated disease outbreak response and mitigation activities. To our knowledge, this is the first prospective prediction of a RVF outbreak."
"Vector borne and zoonotic diseases (Larchmont, N.Y.)","A cross-sectional sero survey of 199 apparently healthy persons from various occupations was carried out in Tanga, Tanzania in November 2004 to investigate exposure to Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus. Sera were tested for the presence of antibodies to RVF virus by the inhibition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detecting immunoglobulin G (IgG). All reactive sera were further tested by the capture ELISA test and specific RVF immunoglobulin M (IgM) assay. Eight (4.0%) tested positive for IgG and none of the samples tested positive for IgM. Among the occupational groups examined, the seroprevalence was 7.3%, 1.5%, and 9.5% in the abattoir workers, livestock keepers, and others categories, respectively. Seropositivity was higher in men (5.3%) than women (1.5 %) and increased markedly in men aged between 20 to 40 years, with no significant differences among the age groups and sexes. The results indicate that a small proportion of people in Tanga municipality were exposed to RVF virus infection prior to 2007 disease outbreak in Tanzania. These findings need to be taken into consideration when future disease control programs are implemented."
"Journal of virological methods","A safe laboratory procedure, based on a sandwich ELISA (sAg-ELISA), was developed and evaluated for the detection of nucleocapsid protein (NP) of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) in specimens inactivated at 56 degrees C for 1h in the presence of 0.5% Tween-20 (v/v) before testing. Polyclonal capture and detection immune sera were generated respectively in sheep and rabbits immunized with recombinant NP antigen. The assay was highly repeatable and specific; it detected strains of RVFV from the entire distributional range of the disease, isolated over a period of 53 years; no cross-reactivity with genetically related African phleboviruses or other members of the family Bunyaviridae was observed. In specimens spiked with RVFV, including human and animal sera, homogenates of liver and spleen tissues of domestic ruminants, and Anopheles mosquito homogenates, the sAg-ELISA detection limit ranged from log(10)10(2.2) to 10(3.2) TCID(50)/reaction volume. The ELISA detected NP antigen in spiked bovine and sheep liver homogenates up to at least 8 days of incubation at 37 degrees C whereas infectious virus could not be detected at 48h incubation in these adverse conditions. Compared to virus isolation from sera from RVF patients and sheep infected experimentally, the ELISA had 67.7% and 70% sensitivity, and 97.97% and 100% specificity, respectively. The assay was 100% accurate when testing tissues of various organs from mice infected experimentally and buffalo foetuses infected naturally. The assay was able to detect NP antigen in infective culture supernatants 16-24h before cytopathic effects were observed microscopically and as early as 8h after inoculation with 10(5.8) TCID(50)/ml of RVFV. This ability renders the assay for rapid identification of the virus when its primary isolation is attempted in vitro. As a highly specific, safe and simple assay format, the sAg-ELISA represents a valuable diagnostic tool for use in less equipped laboratories in Africa, and for routine differential diagnosis of viral hemorrhagic fevers."
"Viruses","Assays to simultaneously detect multiple potential agents of bioterrorism are limited. Two multiplex PCR and RT-PCR enzyme hybridization assays (mPCR-EHA, mRT-PCR-EHA) were developed to simultaneously detect many of the CDC category ""A"" bioterrorism agents. The ""Bio T"" DNA assay was developed to detect: Variola major (VM), Bacillus anthracis (BA), Yersinia pestis (YP), Francisella tularensis (FT) and Varicella zoster virus (VZV). The ""Bio T"" RNA assay (mRT-PCR-EHA) was developed to detect: Ebola virus (Ebola), Lassa fever virus (Lassa), Rift Valley fever (RVF), Hantavirus Sin Nombre species (HSN) and dengue virus (serotypes 1-4). Sensitivity and specificity of the 2 assays were tested by using genomic DNA, recombinant plasmid positive controls, RNA transcripts controls, surrogate (spiked) clinical samples and common respiratory pathogens. The analytical sensitivity (limit of detection (LOD)) of the DNA asssay for genomic DNA was 1x10(0)~1x10(2) copies/mL for BA, FT and YP. The LOD for VZV whole organism was 1x10(-2) TCID(50)/mL. The LOD for recombinant controls ranged from 1x10(2)~1x10(3)copies/mL for BA, FT, YP and VM. The RNA assay demonstrated LOD for RNA transcript controls of 1x10(4)~1x10(6) copies/mL without extraction and 1x10(5)~1x10(6) copies/mL with extraction for Ebola, RVF, Lassa and HSN. The LOD for dengue whole organisms was ~1x10(-4) dilution for dengue 1 and 2, 1x10(4) LD(50)/mL and 1x10(2) LD(50)/mL for dengue 3 and 4. The LOD without extraction for recombinant plasmid DNA controls was ~1x10(3) copies/mL (1.5 input copies/reaction) for Ebola, RVF, Lassa and HSN. No cross-reactivity of primers and probes used in both assays was detected with common respiratory pathogens or between targeted analytes. Clinical sensitivity was estimated using 264 surrogate clinical samples tested with the BioT DNA assay and 549 samples tested with the BioT RNA assay. The clinical specificity is 99.6% and 99.8% for BioT DNA assay and BioT RNA assay, respectively. The surrogate sensitivities of these two assays were 100% (95%CI 83-100) for FT, BA (pX02), YP, VM, VZV, dengue 2,3,4 and 95% (95%CI 75-100) for BA (pX01) and dengue 1 using spiked clinical specimens. The specificity of both BioT multiplex assays on spiked specimens was 100% (95% CI 99-100). Compared to other available assays (culture, serology, PCR, etc.) both the BioT DNA mPCR-EHA and BioT RNA mRT-PCR-EHA are rapid, sensitive and specific assays for detecting many category ""A"" Bioterrorism agents using a standard thermocycler."
"Journal of clinical microbiology","This paper reports on the development and validation of a real-time reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay (RT-LAMP) targeting the genomic large RNA segment of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV). The set of six designed RT-LAMP primers identified strains of RVFV isolated in geographically distinct areas over a period of 50 years; there was no cross-reactivity with other genetically related and unrelated arboviruses. When testing serial sera and plasma from sheep experimentally infected with wild-type RVFV, there was 100% agreement between results of the RT-LAMP, a TaqMan-based real-time PCR, and virus isolation. Similarly, the assay had very high levels of diagnostic sensitivity and specificity when testing various clinical specimens from humans and animals naturally infected with the virus during recent outbreaks of the disease in Africa. The detection of specific viral genome targets in positive clinical specimens was achieved in less than 30 min. As a highly accurate, rapid, and very simple nucleic acid detection format, the RT-LAMP has the potential to be used in less-well-equipped laboratories in Africa and as a portable device during RVF outbreaks in remote areas, and it can be a valuable tool for the differential diagnosis of viral hemorrhagic fevers."
"Geospatial health","A necessary condition for Rift Valley fever (RVF) emergence is the presence of Aedes (Aedimorphus) vexans and Culex (Culex) poicilipes mosquitoes carrying the arbovirus and responsible for the infection. This paper presents a detailed mapping in the Sahelian region of Senegal of zones potentially occupied by these mosquitoes (ZPOMs) whose population density is directly linked to ecozones in the vicinity of small ponds. The vectors habitats and breeding sites have been characterized through an integrated approach combining remote sensing technology, geographical information systems, geographical positioning systems and field observations for proper geo-referencing. From five SPOT-5 images (approximately 10 m spatial resolution) with appropriate channels, a meridional composite transect of 290 x 60 km was first constructed at the height of the summer monsoon. Subsequent ZPOMs covered major ecozones from north to south with different hydrological environments and different patterns pond distributions. It was found that an overall area of 12,817 ha +/- 10% (about 0.8% of the transect) is occupied by ponds with an average ZPOM 17 times larger than this (212,813 ha +/- 10% or about 14% of the transect). By comparing the very humid year of 2003 with 2006 which had just below normal rainfall, the ZPOMs inter-annual variability was analyzed in a sandy-clayey ecozone with an important hydrofossil riverbed within the Ferlo region of Senegal. Very probably contributing to an increased abundance of vectors by the end of August 2003, it was shown that the aggregate pond area was already about 22 times larger than in August 2006, corresponding to an approximately five times larger total ZPOM. The results show the importance of pin-pointing small ponds (sizes down to 0.1 ha) and their geographical distribution in order to assess animal exposure to the RVF vectors."
"Geospatial health","Tele-epidemiology consists in studying human and animal epidemic, the spread of which is closely tied to environmental factors, using data from earth-orbiting satellites. By combining various data originated from satellites such as SPOT (vegetation indexes), Meteosat (winds and cloud masses) and other Earth observation data from Topex/Poseidon and Envisat (wave height, ocean temperature and colour) with hydrology data (number and distribution of lakes, water levels in rivers and reservoirs) and clinical data from humans and animals (clinical cases and serum use), predictive mathematical models can be constructed. A number of such approaches have been tested in the last three years. In Senegal, for example, Rift Valley fever epidemics are being monitored using a predictive model based on the rate at which water holes dry out after the rainy season, which affects the number of mosquito eggs which carry the virus."
"Veterinaria italiana","Great concern is being expressed at the international level on the emergence and re-emergence of certain infectious diseases, many of which are zoonoses, e.g. Rift Valley fever, highly pathogenic avian influenza, etc. Many aspects of globalisation, i.e. the movements of populations, increased urbanisation, greater production and trade in animals and animal products, close interaction between humans and animals, environmental degradation, inappropriate waste disposal, etc., are all determining factors in the prevalence of zoonoses. The Mediterranean and Middle East share similar ecological and epidemiological conditions and are affected by almost the same zoonoses (brucellosis, rabies, echinococcosis, leishmaniosis, salmonellosis, etc.). National control programmes have given partial results or have failed due to weak infrastructures, insufficient financial resources, inadequate intersectoral collaboration and coordination, a lack of public health education, etc. There is an urgent need for the firm commitment of all parties involved on regional, national and international levels to ensure the success of zoonoses prevention and control programmes."
"Bulletin de l'Académie nationale de médecine","In a context in which known and potential zoonoses are emerging (simian retrovirus infections, SRAS, West Nile, H5N1 avian influenza, etc.), French army veterinarians have been tasked with assessing epidemiological risks related to animals in proximity with troops, particularly during foreign operations. They have already completed surveys of more than 70 infections (toxoplasmosis, leishmaniasis, rickettiosis, leptospirosis, Q fever, hepatitis E, Rift valley fever, etc.). The strategy consists of detecting pathogenic agents (""the right sample, at the right time, and kept in the right conditions"") in reservoir animals and vectors, upstream of epidemics. The authors propose to set up a flexible and mobile animal infection detection unit, working closely with hospital physicians, veterinarians and specialized microbiology laboratories. This would be an efficient tool for anticipating, preventing and combating zoonoses."
"Revue scientifique et technique (International Office of Epizootics)","Global changes, including an increase in trade and global warming, which act on the environment, are likely to impact on the evolution of pathogens and hence of diseases. To anticipate the risks created by this new situation, a French group of experts has developed a method for prioritising animal health risks. This is a two-phase method: the first step is to identify the diseases whose incidence or geographical distribution could be affected by the changes taking place, and the second step is to evaluate the risk of each of these diseases. As a result of this process, six priority diseases were selected: bluetongue, Rift Valley fever, West Nile fever, visceral leishmaniasis, leptospirosis and African horse sickness. The main recommendations were: to develop epidemiological surveillance, to increase knowledge of epidemiological cycles, to develop research into these diseases and to pool cross-border efforts to control them."
"Revue scientifique et technique (International Office of Epizootics)","Climate change is likely to change the frequency of extreme weather events, such as tropical cyclones, floods, droughts and hurricanes, and may destabilise and weaken the ecosystem services upon which human society depends. Climate change is also expected to affect animal, human and plant health via indirect pathways: it is likely that the geography of infectious diseases and pests will be altered, including the distribution of vector-borne diseases, such as Rift Valley fever, yellow fever, malaria and dengue, which are highly sensitive to climatic conditions. Extreme weather events might then create the necessary conditions for Rift Valley fever to expand its geographical range northwards and cross the Mediterranean and Arabian seas, with an unexpected impact on the animal and human health of newly affected countries. Strengthening global, regional and national early warning systems is crucial, as are co-ordinated research programmes and subsequent prevention and intervention measures."
"Journal of clinical microbiology","The development and validation of a one-step, single-tube, real-time accelerated reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) for the detection of the L RNA segment of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) are described. The assay was performed at a constant temperature (63 degrees C), with a real-time follow-up using a LightCycler and a double-stranded-DNA-intercalating fluorochrome. The assay is highly sensitive and comparable to real-time RT-PCR, with a detection limit of approximately 10 RNA copies per assay. However, the RT-LAMP assay is much faster than traditional RT-PCR and generates results in <30 min for most diluted samples. The specificity of the primers was established using other, related arboviruses as well as virus-containing and virus-free sera. The RT-LAMP assay reported here is thus a valuable tool for the rapid detection of RVFV in field diagnostic laboratories."
"Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene","While some skeptics remain unconvinced that global climate change is a reality, there is no doubt that during the past 50 years or so, patterns of emerging arbovirus diseases have changed significantly. Can this be attributed to climate change? Climate is a major factor in determining: (1) the geographic and temporal distribution of arthropods; (2) characteristics of arthropod life cycles; (3) dispersal patterns of associated arboviruses; (4) the evolution of arboviruses; and (5) the efficiency with which they are transmitted from arthropods to vertebrate hosts. Thus, under the influence of increasing temperatures and rainfall through warming of the oceans, and alteration of the natural cycles that stabilise climate, one is inevitably drawn to the conclusion that arboviruses will continue to emerge in new regions. For example, we cannot ignore the unexpected but successful establishment of chikungunya fever in northern Italy, the sudden appearance of West Nile virus in North America, the increasing frequency of Rift Valley fever epidemics in the Arabian Peninsula, and very recently, the emergence of Bluetongue virus in northern Europe. In this brief review we ask the question, are these diseases emerging because of climate change or do other factors play an equal or even more important role in their emergence?"
"Journal of virology","Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus historically has caused widespread and extensive outbreaks of severe human and livestock disease throughout Africa, Madagascar, and the Arabian Peninsula. Following unusually heavy rainfall during the late autumn of 2006, reports of human and animal illness consistent with RVF virus infection emerged across semiarid regions of the Garissa District of northeastern Kenya and southern Somalia. Following initial RVF virus laboratory confirmation, a high-throughput RVF diagnostic facility was established at the Kenyan Central Veterinary Laboratories in Kabete, Kenya, to support the real-time identification of infected livestock and to facilitate outbreak response and control activities. A total of 3,250 specimens from a variety of animal species, including domesticated livestock (cattle, sheep, goats, and camels) and wildlife collected from a total of 55 of 71 Kenyan administrative districts, were tested by molecular and serologic assays. Evidence of RVF infection was found in 9.2% of animals tested and across 23 districts of Kenya, reflecting the large number of affected livestock and the geographic extent of the outbreak. The complete S, M, and/or L genome segment sequence was obtained from a total of 31 RVF virus specimens spanning the entire known outbreak period (December-May) and geographic areas affected by RVF virus activity. Extensive genomic analyses demonstrated the concurrent circulation of multiple virus lineages, gene segment reassortment, and the common ancestry of the 2006/2007 outbreak viruses with those from the 1997-1998 east African RVF outbreak. Evidence of recent increases in genomic diversity and effective population size 2 to 4 years prior to the 2006-2007 outbreak also was found, indicating ongoing RVF virus activity and evolution during the interepizootic/epidemic period. These findings have implications for further studies of basic RVF virus ecology and the design of future surveillance/diagnostic activities, and they highlight the critical need for safe and effective vaccines and antiviral compounds to combat this significant veterinary and public health threat."
"BMC molecular biology","Phi29 polymerase based amplification methods provides amplified DNA with minimal changes in sequence and relative abundance for many biomedical applications. RNA virus detection using microarrays, however, can present a challenge because phi29 DNA polymerase cannot amplify RNA nor small cDNA fragments (<2000 bases) obtained by reverse transcription of certain viral RNA genomes. Therefore, ligation of cDNA fragments is necessary prior phi29 polymerase based amplification. We adapted the QuantiTect Whole Transcriptome Kit (Qiagen) to our purposes and designated the method as Whole Transcriptome Amplification (WTA).WTA successfully amplified cDNA from a panel of RNA viruses representing the diversity of ribovirus genome sizes. We amplified a range of genome copy numbers from 15 to 4 x 10(7) using WTA, which yielded quantities of amplified DNA as high as 1.2 microg/microl or 10(10) target copies. The amplification factor varied between 10(9) and 10(6). We also demonstrated that co-amplification occurred when viral RNA was mixed with bacterial DNA.This is the first report in the scientific literature showing that a modified WGA (WTA) approach can be successfully applied to viral genomic RNA of all sizes. Amplifying viral RNA by WTA provides considerably better sensitivity and accuracy of detection compared to random RT-PCR."

"The Journal of general virology","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is responsible for large and recurrent outbreaks of acute febrile illness among humans and domesticated animals in Africa. It belongs to the family Bunyaviridae, genus Phlebovirus, and its negative-stranded RNA genome consists of three segments. Here, we report the establishment and characterization of two different systems to rescue the RVFV wild-type strain ZH548. The first system is based on the BHK-21 cell clone BSR-T7/5, which stably expresses T7 RNA polymerase (T7 pol). Rescue of wild-type RVFV was achieved with three T7 pol-driven cDNA plasmids representing the viral RNA segments in the antigenomic sense. The second system involves 293T cells transfected with three RNA pol I-driven plasmids for the viral segments and two RNA pol II-driven support plasmids to express the viral polymerase components L and N. It is known that the 5' triphosphate group of T7 pol transcripts strongly activates the antiviral interferon system via the intracellular RNA receptor RIG-I. Nonetheless, both the T7 pol and the pol I/II system were of similar efficiency. This was even true for the rescue of a RVFV mutant lacking the interferon antagonist nonstructural proteins. Further experiments demonstrated that the unresponsiveness of BHK-21 and BSR-T7/5 cells to T7 pol transcripts is most probably due to a deficiency in the RIG-I pathway. Our reverse genetics systems now enable us to manipulate the genome of RVFV and study its virulence mechanisms. Moreover, the finding that BHK-derived cell lines have a compromised RIG-I pathway may explain their suitability for propagating and rescuing a wide variety of viruses."
"Journal of virology","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a member of the Bunyaviridae virus family (genus Phlebovirus) and is considered to be one of the most important pathogens in Africa, causing viral zoonoses in livestock and humans. Here, we report the characterization of the three-dimensional structural organization of RVFV vaccine strain MP-12 by cryoelectron tomography. Vitrified-hydrated virions were found to be spherical, with an average diameter of 100 nm. The virus glycoproteins formed cylindrical hollow spikes that clustered into distinct capsomeres. In contrast to previous assertions that RVFV is pleomorphic, the structure of RVFV MP-12 was found to be highly ordered. The three-dimensional map was resolved to a resolution of 6.1 nm, and capsomeres were observed to be arranged on the virus surface in an icosahedral lattice with clear T=12 quasisymmetry. All icosahedral symmetry axes were visible in self-rotation functions calculated using the Fourier transform of the RVFV MP-12 tomogram. To the best of our knowledge, a triangulation number of 12 had previously been reported only for Uukuniemi virus, a bunyavirus also within the Phlebovirus genus. The results presented in this study demonstrate that RVFV MP-12 possesses T=12 icosahedral symmetry and suggest that other members of the Phlebovirus genus, as well as of the Bunyaviridae family, may adopt icosahedral symmetry. Knowledge of the virus architecture may provide a structural template to develop vaccines and diagnostics, since no effective anti-RVFV treatments are available for human use."
"Military medicine","The United States faces many existing and emerging mosquito-borne disease threats, such as West Nile virus and Rift Valley fever. An important component of strategic prevention and control plans for these and other mosquito-borne diseases is forecasting the distribution, timing, and abundance of mosquito vector populations. Populations of many medically important mosquito species are closely tied to climate, and historical climate-population associations may be used to predict future population dynamics. Using 2003-2005 U.S. Army Center for Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine mosquito surveillance data, we looked at populations of several known mosquito vectors of West Nile virus, as well as possible mosquito vectors of Rift Valley fever virus, at continental U.S. military installations. We compared population changes with concurrent patterns for a satellite-derived index of climate (normalized difference vegetation index) and observed instances of population changes appearing to be direct responses to climate. These preliminary findings are important first steps in developing an automated, climate-driven, early warning system to flag regions of the United States at elevated risk of mosquito-borne disease transmission."
"Geospatial health","Recent disease epidemics and their spread around the world have illustrated the weaknesses of disease surveillance and early warning systems (EWS), both at national and international levels. These diseases continuously threaten the livestock sector on a worldwide basis, some with major public health impact. EWS and accurate forecasting of new outbreaks of epidemic livestock diseases that may also affect wildlife, and the capacity for spread of such diseases to new areas is an essential pre-requisite to their effective containment and control. Because both the geographical and seasonal distribution of many infectious diseases are linked to climate, the possibility of using climaterelated environmental factors as predictive indicators, in association with regular disease surveillance activities, has proven to be relevant when establishing EWS for climate-related diseases. This article reviews the growing importance of using geographical information systems in predictive veterinary epidemiology and its integration into EWS, with a special focus on Rift Valley fever. It shows that, once fully validated in a country or region, this technology appears highly valuable and could play an increasing role in forecasting major epidemics, providing lead time to national veterinary services to take action to mitigate the impact of the disease in a cost-effective manner."
"Vaccine","In this work we tested the ability of plasmid DNA constructs encoding structural Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) antigens to induce specific immune responses in sheep. The sole immunization of DNA constructs encoding the glycoprotein precursor NSm/G2/G1 did not suffice to induce a detectable antibody response. In contrast, immunization of sheep with a plasmid vector encoding the viral nucleocapsid protein N elicited a potent and long lasting induction of antibodies but with low neutralizing titers. After DNA immunization, no antigen-specific proliferating cells were detected in sheep PBLs. Boosting with the attenuated vaccine strain MP12 was able to increase the levels of proliferating memory cell pools and induction of IFN-gamma in response to purified virus or recombinant proteins, particularly in sheep vaccinated with a combination of both plasmid constructs. These results open the possibility to exploit this strategy to improve the induction of immune responses against RVFV in sheep."
"Emerging infectious diseases","Most outbreaks of Rift Valley fever (RVF) occur in remote locations after floods. To determine environmental risk factors and long-term sequelae of human RVF, we examined rates of previous Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) exposure by age and location during an interepidemic period in 2006. In a randomized household cluster survey in 2 areas of Ijara District, Kenya, we examined 248 residents of 2 sublocations, Gumarey (village) and Sogan-Godud (town). Overall, the RVFV seropositivity rate was 13% according to immunoglobulin G ELISA; evidence of interepidemic RVFV transmission was detected. Increased seropositivity was found among older persons, those who were male, those who lived in the rural village (Gumarey), and those who had disposed of animal abortus. Rural Gumarey reported more mosquito and animal exposure than Sogan-Godud. Seropositive persons were more likely to have visual impairment and retinal lesions; other physical findings did not differ."
"Bulletin de l'Académie nationale de médecine","Emerging viral diseases are nothing new. Smallpox probably reached Europe from Asia in the 5th century, and yellow fever emerged in the Americas during the 16th century as a consequence of the African slave trade. Dengue fever arose simultaneously in South-East Asia, Africa, and North America during the 18th century. In 1918-1919 the so-called Spanish flu spread like wildfire through all five continents, killing between 25 and 40 million people. The second half of the 20th century saw the emergence of HIV/AIDS (1981), among other viral diseases. Even more worrying is the fact that emerging and re-emerging viral diseases have had a tendency to spread more quickly and more widely during the last decade, invading whole countries and continents; witness the recent outbreaks of Nipah virus, West Nile, Rift Valley fever, SARS, monkeypox, avian flu (H5N1) and Chikungunya. The complex factors underlying these new trends are briefly discussed."
"Preventive veterinary medicine","When early people made their appearance, zoonotic infectious diseases were already waiting, but epidemic diseases did not appear in human history until people began to live in large numbers under conditions of close contact, mainly during the last 10,000 years. Disease has decimated urban populations, conquered armies, and disrupted society. The focus here is on (1) the plague of Athens and the Black Death; (2) smallpox, influenza, and rabies; (3) avian influenza prion diseases, and foot & mouth disease; and (4) emerging and re-emerging diseases. All have veterinary public health associations. In Athens, Greece, in 430 BC, when the Spartans ravaged the countryside, hordes crowded into Athens so that orderly movements, space in which to live, and adequate supplies of food became impossible. Crowding of any population fosters disease transmission; chaos and disorder enhance it all the more. Out of northern Egypt came a terrible plague from across the Mediterranean Sea. The identity of the plague of Athens remains unsure, but the well-considered conclusion is Rift Valley Fever, a mosquito borne, viral zoonosis. The Black Death, also called the Plague, raged in Asia for centuries. In 1347, the Black Death was brought by a ship out of Asia to Sicily. The scenes of devastation were repeated throughout Europe, with 90% or more of the people dying in city after city. Influenza, too, has been a cause of periodic human epidemics, but the great pandemic of influenza occurred in the last months of World War I. In the years of highest occurrence, more than half the world's population became clinically infected. If veterinary public health had been born earlier, it could have led to elucidating the epidemiology of influenza and the plagues of Athens, Europe, and Asia. In turn, smallpox had also caused continual tragedy. In 1796, Edward Jenner began to harvest pustules of cowpox from children or infected cows and inject them into susceptible children. In 1980, the World Health Organization declared that smallpox had been eliminated from the world. Rabies, though, still strikes terror. A number of animal diseases, broadly termed emerging and re-emerging diseases, need surveillance because they have the potential to impact human health. From late in 2003 to 2007, the highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus in poultry infected at least 121 people and caused 62 deaths in four countries. The prion diseases, too, all have very high numbers in concentrated contacts. To control these diseases, veterinary public health is essential, with diagnosis, epidemiological surveillance, clinical manifestations, and prevention as primary measures."
"Virology journal","Studies on Rift Valley Fever Virus (RVFV) infection process and morphogenesis have been hampered due to the biosafety conditions required to handle this virus, making alternative systems such as recombinant virus-like particles, that may facilitate understanding of these processes are highly desirable. In this report we present the expression and characterization of RVFV structural proteins N, Gn and Gc and demonstrate the efficient generation of RVFV virus-like particles (VLPs) using a baculovirus expression system.A recombinant baculovirus, expressing nucleocapsid (N) protein of RVFV at high level under the control of the polyhedrin promoter was generated. Gel filtration analysis indicated that expressed N protein could form complex multimers. Further, N protein complex when visualized by electron microscopy (EM) exhibited particulate, nucleocapsid like-particles (NLPs). Subsequently, a single recombinant virus was generated that expressed the RVFV glycoproteins (Gn/Gc) together with the N protein using a dual baculovirus vector. Both the Gn and Gc glycoproteins were detected not only in the cytoplasm but also on the cell surface of infected cells. Moreover, expression of the Gn/Gc in insect cells was able to induce cell-cell fusion after a low pH shift indicating the retention of their functional characteristics. In addition, assembly of these three structural proteins into VLPs was identified by purification of cells' supernatant through potassium tartrate-glycerol gradient centrifugation followed by EM analysis. The purified particles exhibited enveloped structures that were similar to the structures of the wild-type RVFV virion particle. In parallel, a second recombinant virus was constructed that expressed only Gc protein together with N protein. This dual recombinant virus also generated VLPs with clear spiky structures, but appeared to be more pleomorphic than the VLPs with both glycoproteins, suggesting that Gc and probably also Gn interacts with N protein complex independent of each other.Our results suggest that baculovirus expression system has enormous potential to produce large amount of VLPs that may be used both for fundamental and applied research of RVFV."
"Vector borne and zoonotic diseases (Larchmont, N.Y.)","We evaluated the ability of three mosquito species (Aedes caspius, Aedes detritus, Culex pipiens), collected in southern France and Tunisia, and of different laboratory-established colonies (Aedes aegypti, Aedes albopictus, Aedes vexans, Anopheles gambiae, Culex pipiens, Culex quinquefasciatus) to disseminate two strains of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), the virulent ZH548 and the avirulent Clone 13. After feeding on an infectious blood meal at 10(8.5) plaque-forming units/mL, females were maintained at 30 degrees C for 14 days. Surviving females were tested for the presence of virus on head squashes. Disseminated infection rate corresponds to the number of females with disseminated infection among surviving females. Among field-collected mosquitoes, Cx. pipiens was the most susceptible species with disseminated infection rates ranging from 3.9% to 9.1% for French strains and up to 14.7% for Tunisian strains. Among laboratory-established colonies, Ae. aegypti from Tahiti exhibited the highest disseminated infection rates: 90% when infected with ZH548 and 72.6% with Clone 13. The presence of competent Cx. pipiens in southern France and Tunisia indicates the potential for RVFV epizootics to occur if the virus was introduced into countries of the Mediterranean basin."
"Virology","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV, Bunyaviridae, Phlebovirus) is a mosquito-transmitted arbovirus that causes human and animal diseases in sub-Saharan Africa and was introduced into the Arabian Peninsula in 2000. Here, we describe a method of reverse genetics to recover infectious RVFV from transfected plasmids based on the use of the cellular RNA polymerase I promoter to synthesize viral transcripts. We compared its efficiency with a system using T7 RNA polymerase and found that both are equally efficient for the rescue of RVFV generating titers of approx. 10(7) to 10(8) pfu/ml. We used the RNA polymerase I-based system to rescue both attenuated MP12 and virulent ZH548 strains as well as chimeric MP12-ZH548 viruses, and in addition RVFV expressing reporter proteins."
"Journal of virological methods","Rift Valley Fever (RVF) is an important viral zoonosis in Africa affecting animals and humans. Since no protective vaccines or effective treatments are available for human use, accurate and reliable diagnostic methods are essential for surveillance of the disease in order to implement adequate public health actions. To study the kinetics of the RVF Virus (RVFV) infection, a SYBR Green-based quantitative real-time RT-PCR assay was developed. By using primers targeting the S-segment of RVFV, the detection limit of this assay was estimated to 30 RNA templates. Blood and organs of experimentally infected mice were sampled at different time points and RVFV RNA was quantified. High amounts of RVFV RNA were found in blood, brain, and liver samples shortly after infection with a 1-4 days post infection window for viral RNA detection. Mice developed symptoms after the appearance of serum antibodies, indicating that the host response plays an important role in the outcome of the disease. The RVFV quantitative RT-PCR proved to be a valuable diagnostic tool during the first days of infection, before detectable antibody levels and visual symptoms of RVF were observed."

"PloS one","Innate immunity is critically dependent on the rapid production of interferon in response to intruding viruses. The intracellular pathogen recognition receptors RIG-I and MDA5 are essential for interferon induction by viral RNAs containing 5' triphosphates or double-stranded structures, respectively. Viruses with a negative-stranded RNA genome are an important group of pathogens causing emerging and re-emerging diseases. We investigated the ability of genomic RNAs from substantial representatives of this virus group to induce interferon via RIG-I or MDA5. RNAs isolated from particles of Ebola virus, Nipah virus, Lassa virus, and Rift Valley fever virus strongly activated the interferon-beta promoter. Knockdown experiments demonstrated that interferon induction depended on RIG-I, but not MDA5, and phosphatase treatment revealed a requirement for the RNA 5' triphosphate group. In contrast, genomic RNAs of Hantaan virus, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus and Borna disease virus did not trigger interferon induction. Sensitivity of these RNAs to a 5' monophosphate-specific exonuclease indicates that the RIG-I-activating 5' triphosphate group was removed post-transcriptionally by a viral function. Consequently, RIG-I is unable to bind the RNAs of Hantaan virus, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus and Borna disease virus. These results establish RIG-I as a major intracellular recognition receptor for the genome of most negative-strand RNA viruses and define the cleavage of triphosphates at the RNA 5' end as a strategy of viruses to evade the innate immune response."
"Antiviral research","There are no FDA approved drugs for the treatment of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), a serious human illnesses caused by hantaviruses. Clinical studies using ribavirin (RBV) to treat HFRS patients suggest that it provides an improved prognosis when given early in the course of disease. Given the unique antiviral activity of RBV and the lack of other lead scaffolds, we prepared a diverse series of 3-substituted 1,2,4-triazole-beta-ribosides and identified one with antiviral activity, 1-beta-d-ribofuranosyl-3-ethynyl-[1,2,4]triazole (ETAR). ETAR showed an EC(50) value of 10 and 4.4 microM for Hantaan virus (HTNV) and Andes virus, respectively. ETAR had weak activity against Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, but had no activity against Rift Valley fever virus. Intraperitoneally delivered ETAR offered protection to suckling mice challenged with HTNV with a approximately 25% survival at 12.5 and 25mg/kg ETAR, and a MTD of 17.1+/-0.7 days. ETAR was phosphorylated in Vero E6 cells to its 5'-triphosphate and reduced cellular GTP levels. In contrast to RBV, ETAR did not increase mutation frequency of the HTNV genome, which suggests it has a different mechanism of action than RBV. ETAR is an exciting and promising lead compound that will be elaborated in further synthetic investigations as a framework for the rational design of new antivirals for treatment of HFRS."
"Journal of virological methods","In the collection of field materials to test for the presence of arboviruses, samples must be appropriately maintained to detect arboviral nucleic acids. In austere field conditions this is often difficult to achieve because, during routine specimen processing, storage, and shipping viral RNA degradation could result in detection failure. RNA extraction reagents, while used commonly for their intended purpose of stabilizing RNA during the extraction process, have not been assessed fully for their potential to stabilize RNA before extraction. The potential for virus stabilization at varying temperatures and periods of time remains unknown. Accordingly, the ability of buffer AVL (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), an RNA extraction reagent, to stabilize viral suspensions of dengue, Venezuelan equine encephalitis and Rift Valley fever viruses was evaluated. The ability of buffer AVL to stabilize each viral suspension was examined at 32, 20, 4, and -20 degrees C. RNA in samples placed in buffer AVL was stable for at least 48h at 32 degrees C and refrigerating samples prolonged stabilization. Additionally, placing the sample/buffer AVL mixture at either 4 or -20 degrees C stabilized samples for at least 35 days. When combined with the ability of buffer AVL to inactivate viral samples, this provides the ability to collect and handle potentially infectious samples in a safe way that also provides sample stabilization."

"Parasitology research","Studies were conducted in Mwea Rice Scheme, Kenya during the period April 2005 and January 2007 to determine the host-feeding pattern of culicine mosquitoes. Mosquitoes were collected indoors and outdoors and tested for human, bovine, goat, and donkey blood meals by an Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay. A total of 1,714 blood-engorged samples comprising Culex quinquefasciatus Say (96.1%), Culex annulioris Theobald (1.8%), Culex poicilipes Theobald (0.9%), Aedes cuminsi Theobald (1.0%), Aedes taylori Edwards (0.1%), and Mansonia africana Theobald (0.1%) were tested. Except for A. taylori, in which the single blood meal tested was of bovine origin, the other species fed mostly on both bovine (range 73.3-100%) and goats (range 50-100%). Donkeys were also common hosts for all species (range 19.4-23.5%) except A. taylori and M. africana. C. quinquefasciatus was the only species containing human blood meals (0.04), and indoor collected populations of this species had significantly higher frequency of human blood meals (9.8%) compared with outdoor-collected populations (3.0%). Mixed blood feeding was dominant among culicine species comprising 50.0%, 73.3%, 73.5%, 80.6%, and 94.1% of the samples for M. africana, C. poicilipes, C. quinquefasciatus, C. annulioris, and A. cuminsi, respectively. Ten mixed blood meal combinations including a mixture of all the four hosts were observed in C. quinquefasciatus, compared to one blood meal combination for M. Africana, and two combinations for C. poicilipes, C. annulioris, and A. cuminsi. Mixed bovine and goat blood meal was the most common combination among the five culicine species followed by a mixture of donkey, bovine, and goat blood meals. We conclude that culicine species in Mwea are least likely to be vectors of lymphatic filariasis due to their high ""preference"" for livestock over human hosts, but they present an increased risk for arbovirus transmission particularly Rift Valley Fever virus, in which domestic animals serve as amplification hosts."
"Journal of medical entomology","Outbreaks of Rift Valley fever (RVF) in Egypt, Yemen, and Saudi Arabia have indicated the potential for this disease to spread from its enzootic areas in sub-Saharan Africa. Because little is known about the potential for most African mosquito species to transmit RVF virus (family Bunyaviridae, genus Phlebovirus, RVFV), we conducted studies to determine the vector competence of selected African species of mosquitoes for this virus. All eight species tested [Aedes palpalis (Newstead), Aedes mcintoshi Huang, Aedes circumluteolus (Theobald), Aedes calceatus Edwards, Aedes aegypti (L.), Culex antennatus (Becker), Culex pipiens (L.), and Culex quinquefasciatus Say], were susceptible to infection, and all except Ae. calceatus, Ae. aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus transmitted RVFV by bite after oral exposure. Estimated transmission rates for mosquitoes that successfully transmitted RVFV by bite ranged from 5% for Ae. mcintoshi to 39% for Ae. palpalis for mosquitoes that fed on a hamster with a viremia > or = 10(8) plaque-forming units of virus/ml. We did not recover RVFV from any of 3,138 progeny of infected female mosquitoes. RVFV is unusual among arboviruses in that it has been isolated in nature from a large number of species and that numerous mosquitoes and other arthropods are able to transmit this virus in the laboratory. The recent introduction and spread of West Nile virus into the Americas and the spread of RVFV to the Arabian Peninsula illustrates the potential for viruses, once enzootic in Africa, to spread to other parts of the world."
"Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association","To evaluate the feasibility for Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) to enter the continental United States by various routes as well as to identify states in which domestic and wild ruminant and human populations would be most vulnerable to exposure to RVFV.Pathways analysis.Animals, commodities, and humans transported from RVFV-endemic countries to the continental United States between 2000 and 2005.Initially, agent, host, and environmental factors important in the epidemiologic aspects of RVFV were used to develop a list of potential pathways for release of RVFV into the continental United States. Next, the feasibility of each pathway was evaluated by use of data contained in governmental and public domain sources. Finally, entry points into the continental United States for each feasible pathway were used to identify the domestic and wild ruminant and human populations at risk for exposure to RVFV.Feasible pathways for entry of RVFV into the continental United States were importation of RVFV-infected animals, entry of RVFV-infected people, mechanical transport of RVFV-infected insect vectors, and smuggling of live virus.Domestic ruminant livestock, ruminant wildlife, and people in 14 states (Alabama, California, Florida, Georgia, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas, and Virginia) appeared to be most vulnerable to exposure to RVFV. Pathways analysis can provide the requisite information needed to construct an effective targeted surveillance plan for RVFV to enable rapid detection and response by animal health and public health officials."
"Journal of the American Mosquito Control Association","Rift Valley fever (RVF) continues to be a significant problem in Kenya as well as in Egypt, Yemen, and Saudi Arabia. In order to determine the ability of Kenyan mosquitoes to transmit RVF virus (RVFV), we collected mosquitoes in the Lake Naivasha region of Kenya and evaluated them for their potential to transmit RVFV under laboratory conditions. After feeding on a hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) with a viremia of 10(9.7) plaque-forming units of virus/ml of blood, Culex zombaensis were highly susceptible to infection with RVFV, with 89% becoming infected. In contrast, Cx. quinquefasciatus that were fed on the same hamsters were marginally susceptible, with only 20% becoming infected. Differences in percentages of mosquitoes that developed a disseminated infection were equally disparate, with 55% and 8%, for Cx. zombaensis and Cx. quinquefasciatus, respectively. Forty-eight percent of the Cx. zombaensis with a disseminated infection that fed on a susceptible hamster transmitted virus by bite, indicating a moderate salivary gland barrier. However, the presence of a salivary gland barrier could not be determined for Cx. quinquefasciatus because none of the 18 mosquitoes that took a 2nd blood meal had a disseminated infection. These studies illustrate the need to identify the ability of individual mosquito species to transmit RVFV so that correct decisions can be made concerning the application of appropriate control measures during an outbreak."
"PLoS pathogens","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) nonstructural protein NSs acts as the major determinant of virulence by antagonizing interferon beta (IFN-beta) gene expression. We demonstrate here that NSs interacts with the host protein SAP30, which belongs to Sin3A/NCoR/HDACs repressor complexes and interacts with the transcription factor YY1 that regulates IFN-beta gene expression. Using confocal microscopy and chromatin immunoprecipitation, we show that SAP30, YY1, and Sin3A-associated corepressor factors strongly colocalize with nuclear NSs filaments and that NSs, SAP30 and Sin3A-associated factors are recruited on the IFN-beta promoter through YY1, inhibiting CBP recruitment, histone acetylation, and transcriptional activation. To ascertain the role of SAP30, we produced, by reverse genetics, a recombinant RVFV in which the interacting domain in NSs was deleted. The virus was unable to inhibit the IFN response and was avirulent for mice. We discuss here the strategy developed by the highly pathogenic RVFV to evade the host antiviral response, affecting nuclear organization and IFN-beta promoter chromatin structure."
"Antiviral research","Punta Toro virus (PTV) is a member of the Bunyaviridae family, genus Phlebovirus, related to the highly pathogenic Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV). It produces a disease in hamsters that models severe Rift Valley fever (RVF) in humans. The recent outbreak of RVF in Kenya stresses the need to identify prophylactic and therapeutic measures for preventing and treating severe forms of disease. To this end, interferon (IFN) alfacon-1 (consensus IFN-alpha) was evaluated in cell culture against RVFV and PTV, and in the hamster PTV infection model. Survival outcome following treatment initiated pre- and post-virus challenge and the suppression of viral burden and liver disease in infected hamsters was determined. Pre-treatment of cell cultures with IFN alfacon-1 induced marked antiviral activity against both viruses. Intraperitoneal treatment of hamsters initiated 4 h prior to infection with PTV was highly protective and greatly limited liver disease and systemic and liver viral burden. Complete protection from a highly lethal challenge dose was afforded by treatment initiated 36 h following viral inoculation. Although efficacy was much reduced, IFN alfacon-1 therapy was still beneficial when started as late as 3-5 days post-virus exposure. These studies suggest that IFN alfacon-1 may be an effective treatment for early intervention following infection with RVFV."
"Emerging infectious diseases","In October 2003, 9 human cases of hemorrhagic fever were reported in 3 provinces of Mauritania, West Africa. Test results showed acute Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) infection, and a field investigation found recent circulation of RVFV with a prevalence rate of 25.5% (25/98) and 4 deaths among the 25 laboratory-confirmed case-patients. Immunoglobulin M against RVFV was found in 46% (25/54) of domestic animals. RVFV was also isolated from the mosquito species Culex poicilipes. Genetic comparison of virion segments indicated little variation among the strains isolated. However, phylogenetic studies clearly demonstrated that these strains belonged to the East-Central African lineage for all segments. To our knowledge, this is the first time viruses of this lineage have been observed in an outbreak in West Africa. Whether these strains were introduced or are endemic in West Africa remains to be determined."
"Journal of virology","Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus is a mosquito-borne human and veterinary pathogen associated with large outbreaks of severe disease throughout Africa and more recently the Arabian peninsula. Infection of livestock can result in sweeping ""abortion storms"" and high mortality among young animals. Human infection results in self-limiting febrile disease that in approximately 1 to 2% of patients progresses to more serious complications including hepatitis, encephalitis, and retinitis or a hemorrhagic syndrome with high fatality. The virus S segment-encoded NSs and the M segment-encoded NSm proteins are important virulence factors. The development of safe, effective vaccines and tools to screen and evaluate antiviral compounds is critical for future control strategies. Here, we report the successful reverse genetics generation of multiple recombinant enhanced green fluorescent protein-tagged RVF viruses containing either the full-length, complete virus genome or precise deletions of the NSs gene alone or the NSs/NSm genes in combination, thus creating attenuating deletions on multiple virus genome segments. These viruses were highly attenuated, with no detectable viremia or clinical illness observed with high challenge dosages (1.0 x 10(4) PFU) in the rat lethal disease model. A single-dose immunization regimen induced robust anti-RVF virus immunoglobulin G antibodies (titer, approximately 1:6,400) by day 26 postvaccination. All vaccinated animals that were subsequently challenged with a high dose of virulent RVF virus survived infection and could be serologically differentiated from naïve, experimentally infected animals by the lack of NSs antibodies. These rationally designed marker RVF vaccine viruses will be useful tools for in vitro screening of therapeutic compounds and will provide a basis for further development of RVF virus marker vaccines for use in endemic regions or following the natural or intentional introduction of the virus into previously unaffected areas."

We then applied this model to the temporal domain and propose a heuristic staging model, the Wilson-Collmann Scale for assessing biological event evolution.We retrospectively and manually examined hard copy archival local media reports in the native vernacular for three biological events associated with substantial social disruption. The model was then tested prospectively through media harvesting based on keywords corresponding to the model parameters.Our heuristic staging model provides valuable information about the features of a biological event that can be used to determine the level of concern warranted, such as whether the pathogen in question is responding to established public health disease control measures, including the use of antimicrobials or vaccines; whether the public health and medical infrastructure of the country involved is adequate to mount the necessary response; whether the country's officials are providing an appropriate level of information to international public health authorities; and whether the event poses a international threat. The approach is applicable for monitoring open-source (public-domain) media for indications and warnings of such events, and specifically for markers of the social disruption that commonly occur as these events unfold. These indications and warnings can then be used as the basis for staging the biological threat in the same manner that the United States National Weather Service currently uses storm warning models (such as the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale) to detect and assess threatening weather conditions.Used as a complement to current epidemiological surveillance methods, our approach could aid global public health officials and national political leaders in responding to biological threats of international public health significance."

"Antiviral chemistry & chemotherapy","We designed and synthesized novel 2,3-disubstituted quinazolin-4(3H)-ones by microwave technique and characterized them by spectral analysis. Synthesized compounds were screened for cytotoxicity and for antiviral activity against influenza A (H1N1, H3N2 and H5N1), severe acute respiratory syndrome corona, dengue, yellow fever, Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE), Rift Valley fever, and Tacaribe viruses in cell culture. A neutral red uptake assay was used to determine 50% virus-inhibitory concentrations (EC50) of test compounds and their 50% cytotoxicity concentration (CC50) in uninfected Madin-Darby canine kidney, Vero, and Vero 76 cells; selectivity indices (ratio of CC50 to EC50) were derived from the data. The compound 4-(6,8-dibromo-4-oxo-2-phenyl quinazolin-3(4H)-yl)-N-(4,5-dimethyloxazol-2yl) benzenesulphonamide 15 inhibited the replication of avian influenza (H5N1) virus (EC50 = 8.4 microg/ml, CC50 > 100 microg/ml, SI > 11.9) as did 4-(6-bromo-4oxo-2phenylquinazolin-3(4H)-yl) benzene]sulphonamide 5 (EC50 = 3 microg/ml, CC50 = 32 microg/ml, SI = 11). Compound 5 was also moderately active against VEE and Tacaribe viruses. The methodology described in this report is applicable for rapid synthesis of many compounds with potential antiviral properties."
"Antiviral research","With intensification of trade, livestock are increasingly exposed to severe animal diseases caused by a range of RNA viruses. Recent prime examples include outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), peste des petits ruminants, Rift Valley fever and bluetongue. To minimise their impact, controlling the spread of virus is of utmost importance. Good quality, reliable vaccines exist for some, although not all, of these diseases, but suffer from a set of drawbacks, not the least of which being the time needed to trigger the immune response (i.e. ""immunity-gap""). Effective, rapid control tools are, therefore, urgently needed and antiviral compounds could serve this purpose. Although limited in vitro and in vivo research has been performed, encouraging results for FMD suggest that livestock could be protected against infection within 24h following antiviral treatment and up to 12h post-infection. Such prophylactic/therapeutic antiviral drugs could complement emergency vaccination in a previously disease-free setting or be applied to treat valuable zoological collections and breeding stocks in endemic and previously disease-free regions alike. This paper will primarily focus on the effects of FMD on livestock and other sectors, and on appropriate control tools. The outlined principles can be extrapolated to other RNA viral diseases."

The sensitivity of the SFNV assay was not determined. The TOSV and the RVFV assays detected recent isolates from Spain and Africa, respectively.The assays should help to improve surveillance of pathogenic Phleboviruses."
"Epidemiology and infection","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is an arbovirus associated with periodic outbreaks, mostly on the African continent, of febrile disease accompanied by abortion in livestock, and a severe, fatal haemorrhagic syndrome in humans. However, the maintenance of the virus during the inter-epidemic period (IEP) when there is low or no disease activity detected in livestock or humans has not been determined. This study report prevalence of RVFV-neutralizing antibodies in sera (n=896) collected from 16 Kenyan wildlife species including at least 35% that were born during the 1999-2006 IEP. Specimens from seven species had detectable neutralizing antibodies against RVFV, including African buffalo, black rhino, lesser kudu, impala, African elephant, kongoni, and waterbuck. High RVFV antibody prevalence (>15%) was observed in black rhinos and ruminants (kudu, impala, buffalo, and waterbuck) with the highest titres (up to 1:1280) observed mostly in buffalo, including animals born during the IEP. All lions, giraffes, plains zebras, and warthogs tested were either negative or less than two animals in each species had low (<or= 1:16) titres of RVFV antibodies. Of 249 sera collected from five wildlife species during the 2006-2007 outbreak, 16 out of 19 (84%) of the ruminant (gerenuk, waterbuck, and eland) specimens had RVFV-neutralizing titres >or= 1:80. These data provide evidence that wild ruminants are infected by RVFV but further studies are required to determine whether these animals play a role in the virus maintenance between outbreaks and virus amplification prior to a noticeable outbreak."
"Journal of interferon & cytokine research : the official journal of the International Society for Interferon and Cytokine Research","Influenza A virus (FLUAV) is an important human pathogen able to cause devastating pandemics. Recently, cotton rats have been proposed as an animal model to study the innate immune response against FLUAV and other human pathogens. The interferon (IFN)-induced Mx GTPases are part of the cell-autonomous innate immune response against viruses. We, therefore, tested the antiviral activity of the two cotton rat Mx proteins that were recently identified. The nuclear cotton rat Mx1 protein was found to be a strong inhibitor of FLUAV, whereas the cytoplasmic cotton rat Mx2 protein was inactive. Cotton rat Mx2, but not cotton rat Mx1, was able to inhibit the rhabdovirus vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and the bunyavirus Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) known to replicate in the cytoplasm of infected cells. Thus, cotton rats possess two Mx proteins that have selective antiviral activity that depends on their intracellular localization. We conclude that the Mx status of cotton rats differs from that of conventional inbred mouse strains, which are known to have defective Mx genes. Therefore, cotton rats are a suitable animal model to study experimental infections with FLUAV and other RNA viruses."
"Wei sheng wu xue bao = Acta microbiologica Sinica","DNA vaccines have successfully induced effective antibody and cellular immune response to many viral pathogens. The antibody response of DNA immunization induction in mouse model with envelope glycoproteins of Rift Valley Fever Virus (RVFV), G (N + C), GN and GC was investigated. For this purpose, three codon G (N + C), GN and GC gene were insert into mammalian expression vector pCAGGS under chicken beta-actin promoter to construct pCAGG-RVFV-GN, pCAGG-RVFV-GC and pCAGG-RVFV-G (N + C). The expression of recommbinant GN or / and GC protein in BHK cells transfected with pCAGG-RVFV-GC or pCAGG-RVFV-G (N + C) DNA were confirmed by immunoprecipitation. Six-week-old female BALB/c mice were intramuscularly primed with 100 (g pCAGG-RVFV-GN + pCAGG-RVFV-GC + pCAGG-RVFV-G (N + C), and boosted with same dose after 4 weeks. The serums were collected at 3 weeks post final boost. The serum IgG against Rift Valley Fever Virus G (N + C) protein were detect by indirect ELISA using recombinant Baculovirus expressed Rift Valley Fever Virus GN and GC glycoprotein. The mixture of pCAGG-RVFV-GN, pCAGG-RVFV-GC and pCAGG-RVFV-G (N + C) elicited much strong IgG response. For serum neutralization antibody assay, a recombinant Vesicular Stomatitis Virus pseudotype, in which the VSV envelope protein G gene was replaced with the green fluorescent protein gene (VSVdeltaG x G, Whitt M A) and complemented with Rift Valley Fever Virus G (N + C) glycoprotein expressed in transient (VSVdeltaG x RVFV-G), was use to replace the authentic Rift Valley Fever Virus. The mixture of pCAGG-RVFV-GN, pCAGG-RVFV-GC and pCAGG-RVFV-G (N + C) also induced high titer of neutralization antibody response. These result indicates that DNA immunization is an efficient vaccine strategy against Rift Valley Fever Virus."
"Journal of virology","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a member of the genus Phlebovirus within the family Bunyaviridae. It can cause severe epidemics among ruminants and fever, myalgia, a hemorrhagic syndrome, and/or encephalitis in humans. The RVFV M segment encodes the NSm and 78-kDa proteins and two major envelope proteins, Gn and Gc. The biological functions of the NSm and 78-kDa proteins are unknown; both proteins are dispensable for viral replication in cell cultures. To determine the biological functions of the NSm and 78-kDa proteins, we generated the mutant virus arMP-12-del21/384, carrying a large deletion in the pre-Gn region of the M segment. Neither NSm nor the 78-kDa protein was synthesized in arMP-12-del21/384-infected cells. Although arMP-12-del21/384 and its parental virus, arMP-12, showed similar growth kinetics and viral RNA and protein accumulation in infected cells, arMP-12-del21/384-infected cells induced extensive cell death and produced larger plaques than did arMP-12-infected cells. arMP-12-del21/384 replication triggered apoptosis, including the cleavage of caspase-3, the cleavage of its downstream substrate, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, and activation of the initiator caspases, caspase-8 and -9, earlier in infection than arMP-12. NSm expression in arMP-12-del21/384-infected cells suppressed the severity of caspase-3 activation. Further, NSm protein expression inhibited the staurosporine-induced activation of caspase-8 and -9, demonstrating that other viral proteins were dispensable for NSm's function in inhibiting apoptosis. RVFV NSm protein is the first identified Phlebovirus protein that has an antiapoptotic function."
"Veterinary microbiology","Wild ruminants are thought to serve as natural hosts for Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) but the role of these animals as reservoirs for RVFV during inter-epidemic periods and as amplifiers during epidemics is not well understood. An indirect enzyme-linked immunoassay (I-ELISA) based on the recombinant nucleocapsid protein (rNp) of RVFV was validated for the detection of specific IgG antibodies in African buffalo. Data sets derived from testing buffalo sera from Kenya (n=405) and South Africa (n=618) were dichotomised according to the results of a virus neutralisation test. The assay characteristic performance was analysed using threshold values optimised by the two-graph receiver operating characteristics (TG-ROC) analysis, and by mean plus two, as well as by mean plus three standard deviations derived from I-ELISA PP values in uninfected animals. Among 1023 buffalo sera tested, 77 (7.5%) had detectable virus neutralising antibodies. The assay had high intra- and inter-plate repeatability in routine runs. At a cut-off optimised by the TG-ROC at 95% accuracy level, the diagnostic sensitivity of the I-ELISA was 98.7% and diagnostic specificity 99.36% while estimates for the Youden's index (J) and efficiency (Ef) were 0.98 and 99.31%. When cut-off values determined by traditional statistical approaches were used, the diagnostic sensitivity was 100% but estimates of J, Ef and other combined measures of diagnostic accuracy were lower compared to those based on cut-off value derived from the TG-ROC. Results of the study indicate that the I-ELISA based on the rNp would be useful for seroepidemiological studies of RVFV infections in African buffalo."
"Journal of virological methods","This paper describes the development and evaluation of an optical fiber immunosensor (OFIS) for the detection of IgG antibody to Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) in humans. The OFIS was based on a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (S-ELISA) format, whereby gamma-irradiated RVFV and control antigens were immobilized on the optical fiber surface coated with a mouse anti-RVFV antibody. Data sets derived from field-collected sera in Africa (n=242) were dichotomized according to the results of a virus neutralization test. Compared to standard colorimetric S-ELISA, the OFIS technique was more sensitive in detecting smaller quantity of specific IgG to RVFV in human sera. At cut-off value selected at a 95% accuracy level by the two-graph receiver operating characteristic analysis, the OFIS diagnostic sensitivity was 97.22% and diagnostic specificity 98.86%. Our results demonstrate that the OFIS technology reported here is highly accurate, simple to perform and has the potential to be used in a portable format."
"Journal of clinical microbiology","Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus is a mosquito-borne virus associated with large-scale epizootics/epidemics throughout Africa and the Arabian peninsula. Virus infection can result in economically disastrous ""abortion storms"" and high newborn mortality in livestock. Human infections result in a flu-like illness, with 1 to 2% of patients developing severe complications, including encephalitis or hemorrhagic fever with high fatality rates. There is a critical need for a highly sensitive and specific molecular diagnostic assay capable of detecting the natural genetic spectrum of RVF viruses. We report here the establishment of a pan-RVF virus quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR assay with high analytical sensitivity (approximately 5 RNA copies of in vitro-transcribed RNA/reaction or approximately 0.1 PFU of infectious virus/reaction) and efficiency (standard curve slope = -3.66). Based on the alignments of the complete genome sequences of 40 ecologically and biologically diverse virus isolates collected over 56 years (1944 to 2000), the primer and probe annealing sites targeted in this assay are known to be located in highly conserved genomic regions. The performance of this assay relative to serologic assays is illustrated by testing of known RVF case materials obtained during the Saudi Arabia outbreak in 2000. Furthermore, analysis of acute-phase blood samples collected from human patients (25 nonfatal, 8 fatal) during that outbreak revealed that patient viremia at time of presentation at hospital may be a useful prognostic tool in determining patient outcome."

"Tropical medicine & international health : TM & IH","To determine whether the Koka water reservoir in the Rift Valley of Ethiopia contributes to the malaria burden in its vicinity.Frequency of malaria diagnosis in fever clinics was correlated with distance of residence from the margin of the Koka reservoir. Annual as well as seasonal malaria case rates were determined in cohorts residing < 3, 3-6 and 6-9 km from the reservoir. Plasmodium falciparum risk was compared with that of Plasmodium vivax. A multiple variable regression model was used to explore associations between malaria case rates and proximity to the reservoir, controlling for other suspected influences on malaria transmission.Malaria case rates among people living within 3 km of the reservoir are about 1.5 times as great as for those living between 3 and 6 km from the reservoir and 2.3 times as great for those living 6-9 km from the reservoir. Proximity to the reservoir is associated with greater malaria case rates in periods of more intense transmission. Plasmodium falciparum is most prevalent in communities located close to the reservoir and P. vivax in more distant villages. The presence of the reservoir, coupled with inter-annual climatic variations, explains more than half of the region's variability in malaria case rates.Large water impoundments are likely to exacerbate malaria transmission in malaria-endemic parts of sub-Saharan Africa."
"Journal of virological methods","An indirect enzyme-linked immunoassay (I-ELISA) based on the recombinant nucleocapsid protein (rNp) of Rift Valley fever virus was validated for the detection of specific IgG antibody in human sera. Validation data sets derived from testing sera collected in Africa (n=2967) were categorized according to the results of a virus neutralisation test. The assay had high intra- and inter-plate repeatability in routine runs. No detectable cross-reactions between IgG antibodies generated from mice experimentally infected with viruses representing genus Phlebovirus, Nairovirus, Orthobunyavirus and Bhanja virus of the family Bunyaviridae were observed. At a cut-off optimised by the two-graph receiver operating characteristics analysis at 95% accuracy level, the diagnostic sensitivity of the I-ELISA was 99.72% and diagnostic specificity 99.62% while estimates for the Youden's index (J) and efficiency (Ef) were 0.993 and 99.62%. When cut-off values determined by mean plus two and by mean plus three standard deviations derived from I-ELISA readings in an uninfected reference population were used, the diagnostic sensitivity was 100% but estimates of Y, Ef and other combined measures of diagnostic accuracy were lower. The I-ELISA based on rNp is highly sensitive, specific and robust and can be applied for diagnosis of infection of Rift Valley fever and disease-surveillance studies in humans."
"Journal of virological methods","Lumpy skin disease virus (LSDV) is being developed as a vector for recombinant vaccines against diseases of veterinary importance. A strategy for generating viral thymidine kinase (TK) gene-disrupted recombinants which are stable and homogeneous using the South African Neethling vaccine strain of LSDV as vector has been developed. To assist with the selection process, the Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase (lacZ) visual marker gene was incorporated into the constructs. However, the use of lacZ has certain limitations. An improved strategy was then devised substituting lacZ with the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) under control of the vaccinia virus (VV) P11K late promoter. The EGFP marker was found to enhance the selection process, and with the inclusion of additional sonication and filtration steps the number of passages required to select recombinants to homogeneity has been reduced. In support of the improved method for generation and selection of recombinants described, three different LSDV recombinants expressing the glycoprotein genes of bovine ephemeral fever virus, Rift Valley fever virus and rabies virus were prepared and characterised."

"Vector borne and zoonotic diseases (Larchmont, N.Y.)","Rift Valley fever (RVF) is broadening its geographic range and is increasingly becoming a disease of global importance with potentially severe consequences for human and animal health. We conducted a spatial risk assessment of RVF in Senegal using serologic data from 16,738 animals in 211 locations. Bayesian spatial regression models were developed with interpolated seasonal rainfall, land surface temperature, distance to perennial water bodies, and time of year entered as fixed-effect variables. Average total monthly rainfall during December-February was the most important spatial predictor of risk of positive RVF serologic status. Maps derived from the models highlighted the lower Senegal River basin and the southern border regions of Senegal as high-risk areas. These risk maps are suitable for use in planning improved sentinel surveillance systems in Senegal, although further data collection is required in large areas of Senegal to better define the spatial distribution of RVF."
"Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy","There is a need for the development of effective antivirals for the treatment of severe viral diseases caused by members of the virus families Bunyaviridae and Arenaviridae. The pyrazine derivative T-705 (6-fluoro-3-hydroxy-2-pyrazinecarboxamide) has demonstrated remarkable antiviral activity against influenza virus and, to a lesser degree, against some other RNA viruses (Y. Furuta, K. Takahashi, Y. Fukuda, M. Kuno, T. Kamiyama, K. Kozaki, N. Nomura, H. Egawa, S. Minami, Y. Watanabe, H. Narita, and K. Shiraki, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother., 46:977-981, 2002). Here, we report that T-705 is highly active against a panel of bunyaviruses (La Crosse, Punta Toro, Rift Valley fever, and sandfly fever viruses) and arenaviruses (Junin, Pichinde, and Tacaribe viruses) by cytopathic effect and virus yield reduction cell-based assays. The 50% effective concentrations for T-705 ranged from 5 to 30 microg/ml and 0.7 to 1.2 microg/ml against the bunyaviruses and arenaviruses examined, respectively. We also demonstrate that orally administered T-705 is efficacious in treating Punta Toro virus in the mouse and hamster infection models, as well as Pichinde virus infection in hamsters. When administered twice daily for 5 to 6 days, beginning 4 h pre- or 24 h post-Punta Toro virus challenge, a 30-mg/kg of body weight/day dose provided complete protection from death and limited viral burden and liver disease. A dose of 50 mg/kg/day was found to be optimal for treating Pichinde infection and limiting viral replication and disease severity. In general, T-705 was found to be more active than ribavirin in cell-based assays and in vivo, as reflected by substantially greater therapeutic indexes. Our results suggest that T-705 may be a viable alternative for the treatment of life-threatening bunyaviral and arenaviral infections."
"Veterinaria italiana","Rift Valley fever (RVF) is an acute arboviral disease of domestic ungulates and humans in Africa and the Middle East. Since the first epidemic in 1987, Senegal has been confronted with recurrent episodes of the disease. This study aimed to model spatial distribution of ruminants in the agropastoral area of Barkedji (Senegal) where the disease is enzootic. In this Sahelian ecosystem, livestock distribution mainly depends on the availability of resources. Accordingly, remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS) were used to seek environmental indicators of livestock density. A high-resolution Landsat image was associated with landscape field data to describe the land-cover. A series of normalized difference vegetation index values gave an estimation of the phytomass. In addition the compounds of herders in the study zone were located and sampled. Three surveys were conducted during the rainy season to record the number of herds in each compound of the sample. All these data were overlaid in the GIS. A discriminant analysis was performed to associate the observed herd density with environmental data and to develop a predictive model for the entire study zone. The final result was a 1-km resolution raster map of herd density during a normal rainy season."
"Veterinaria italiana","The authors developed a monitoring and risk mapping system using normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) times series data derived from the advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) instrument on polar orbiting national oceanographic and atmospheric administration (NOAA) satellites to map areas with a potential for a Rift Valley fever (RVF) outbreaks in sub-Saharan Africa. This system is potentially an important tool for local, national and international organisations involved in the prevention and control of animal and human disease, permitting focused and timely implementation of disease control strategies several months before an outbreak. We are currently developing a geographic information system (GIS)-based remotely sensed early warning system for potential RVF vectors in the United States. Forecasts of the potential emergence of mosquito vectors will be disseminated throughout the United States, providing several months' warning in advance of potentially elevated mosquito populations. This would allow timely, targeted implementation of mosquito control, animal quarantine and vaccine strategies to reduce or prevent animal and human disease."
"Veterinaria italiana","In recent years, several vector-borne, parasitic or zoonotic diseases have emerged or re-emerged in different parts of the world, with major public health, socio-economic and political consequences. Emergence of these diseases is linked to climatic change, human-induced landscape changes and human activities that have affected disease ecology. The authors illustrate geographic information system-based approaches to understand epidemiological processes and predict disease patterns. Continent-wide approaches are used to explore vector and host distributions and identify areas where substantial changes in vector and vector-borne disease distributions have occurred. Time series of high-resolution satellite data and locally collected data reveal the spatial relationships between factors impacting disease dynamics. Using Rift Valley fever as a case study, a conceptual approach is proposed to integrate all of these data and to identify key parameters for disease modelling. Some of the challenges posed by different spatial and temporal scales of the biological processes and associated indicators are highlighted."
"Preventive veterinary medicine","Rift Valley fever (RVF) epidemics have serious consequences for human and animal health and the livestock trade. Recent epidemics have occurred in previously unaffected regions, increasing concerns that the geographical range of RVF will continue to expand. We conducted an extensive, systematic review of the literature to obtain serological data for RVF in Africa, collected between 1970 and 2000 from human, livestock and wild ungulate populations. Aims were to calculate sub-national estimates of RVF infection prevalence and to define areas where no information was available. We presented the data (aggregated at the first administrative level of countries) using a geographical information system. Data from 71 publications were used to build a spatially explicit Bayesian logistic-regression model, with spatial and non-spatial random effects, allowing us to identify clusters of high and low RVF seroprevalence, and fixed effects that described the disparate nature of the survey subjects and methods. Significant high-prevalence clusters encompassed areas that had experienced epidemics during the late 20th century and significant low-prevalence clusters were located in contiguous areas of Western and Central Africa."
"The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene","Preliminary serologic data indicated that two South American phleboviruses (Belterra virus [BELTV] and Icoaraci virus [ICOV]) may be related to Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), an African phlebovirus that causes severe hepatitis and hemorrhagic fever in humans. To further define this relationship and to investigate the underlying genetic basis, comparative serologic and genetic sequence analyses were performed with RVFV and five other New World phleboviruses (ICOV, BELTV, Salobo virus, Joa virus, and Frijoles virus). Serologically, a one-way cross reaction was confirmed between antibodies against these New World viruses and RVFV antigen. In contrast, phylogenetic analysis demonstrated clear separation of these viruses from RVFV, into distinct phylogenies, based on sequences of the small, medium, and large RNA segments."
"Journal of virology","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) (genus Phlebovirus, family Bunyaviridae) has a tripartite negative-strand genome and causes a mosquito-borne disease among humans and livestock in sub-Saharan African and Arabian Peninsula countries. Phlebovirus L, M, and N mRNAs are synthesized from the virus-sense RNA segments, while NSs mRNA is transcribed from the anti-virus-sense S segment. The present study determined the 3' termini of all RVFV mRNAs. The 3' termini of N and NSs mRNAs were mapped within the S-segment intergenic region and were complementary to each other by 30 to 60 nucleotides. The termini of M and L mRNAs were mapped within 122 to 107 nucleotides and 16 to 41 nucleotides, respectively, from the 5' ends of their templates. Viral RNA elements that control phlebovirus transcriptional terminations are largely unknown. Our studies suggested the importance of a pentanucleotide sequence, CGUCG, for N, NSs, and M mRNA transcription terminations. Homopolymeric tracts of C sequences, which were located upstream of the pentanucleotide sequence, promoted N and M mRNA terminations. Likewise, the homopolymeric tracts of G sequences that are found upstream of the pentanucleotide sequence promoted NSs mRNA termination. The L-segment 5'-untranslated region (L-5' UTR) had neither the pentanucleotide sequence nor homopolymeric sequences, yet replacement of the S-segment intergenic region with the L-5' UTR exerted N mRNA termination in an infectious virus. The L-5' UTR contained two 13-nucleotide-long complete complementary sequences, and their sequence complementarities were important for L mRNA termination. A computer-mediated RNA secondary structure analysis further suggested that RNA secondary structures formed by the sections of the two 13-nucleotide-long sequences and by the sequence between them may have a role in L mRNA termination. Our data demonstrated that viral RNA elements that govern L mRNA termination differed from those that regulate mRNA terminations in the M and S segments."

"Virology","During the last decade, alphaviruses became widely used for expression of heterologous genetic information and development of recombinant vaccines against a variety of human and animal pathogens. In this study, we compared a number of vectors based on the genome of Sindbis (SINV) and Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEEV) viruses for their ability to express the Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) envelope glycoprotein Gn and induce a protective immune response against RVFV infection. Our results suggest that (i) application of VEEV-based expression systems appears to be advantageous, when compared to similar systems designed on the basis of the SINV genome. (ii) Alphavirus-specific E3 and E2 proteins and furin-specific cleavage sites can be used for engineering secreted forms of the proteins. (iii) Alphaviruses can be modified for expression of the large fragments of heterologous proteins on the surface of chimeric, infectious viral particles. Thus, alphavirus-based expression systems may have the potential for a broader application beyond their current use as replicons or double-subgenomic vectors."
"The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene","Transmission experiments are essential to assess vector competence. In an attempt to study Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) transmission in its arthropod vector, disseminated infection rates were measured in Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus exposed to Clone 13, an avirulent variant of RVFV. We compared the classic system of glass feeders covered with different membranes (0-1%) with an alternative system in which a cotton stick is used as a support of a blood meal. The latter system showed the highest successful feeding rate (80%). Using this system, we optimized two parameters to obtain the highest numbers of engorged females and thus the highest numbers of females with disseminated infection: 1) use of freshly collected washed erythrocytes and 2) duration of the extrinsic incubation period of at least 14 days after infection."
"The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is an emerging pathogen that maintains high biodefense priority based on its threat to livestock, its ability to cause human hemorrhagic fever, and its potential for aerosol spread. To define the range of human transmission during inter-epidemic and epidemic periods in Kenya, we tested archived sera from defined populations (N = 1,263) for anti-RVFV IgG by ELISA and plaque reduction neutralization testing. RVFV seroprevalence was 10.8% overall and varied significantly by location, sex, and age. In NW Kenya, high seroprevalence among those born before 1980 indicates that an undetected epidemic may have occurred then. Seroconversion documented in highland areas suggests previously unsuspected inter-epidemic transmission. RVFV seroprevalence is strikingly high in certain Kenyan areas, suggesting endemic transmission patterns that may preclude accurate estimation of regional acute outbreak incidence. The extent of both epidemic and inter-epidemic RVFV transmission in Kenya is greater than previously documented."

"Virology","Rift Valley fever virus is a significant human and veterinary pathogen responsible for explosive outbreaks throughout Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. Severe acute disease in humans includes rapid onset hepatic disease and hemorrhagic fever or delayed onset encephalitis. A highly efficient reverse genetics system was developed which allowed generation of recombinant RVF viruses to assess the role of NSm protein in virulence in a rat model in which wild-type RVF virus strain ZH501 (wt-ZH501) results in 100% lethal hepatic disease 2-3 days post infection. While extensive genomic analysis indicates conservation of the NSm coding capability of diverse RVF viruses, and viruses deficient in NSs proteins are completely attenuated in vivo, comparison of wt-ZH501, a reverse genetics generated wt-ZH501 virus (R-ZH501), and R-ZH501 virus lacking the NSm proteins (R-DeltaNSm-ZH501) demonstrated that the NSm proteins were nonessential for in vivo virulence and lethality. Surprisingly, while 44% of R-DeltaNSm-ZH501 infected animals quickly developed lethal hepatic disease similar to wt- and R-ZH501, 17% developed delayed onset neurologic disease (lethargy, head tremors, and ataxia) at 13 days post infection. Such infections may provide the basis for study of both RVF acute hepatic disease and delayed onset encephalitic disease in humans."

"Revue scientifique et technique (International Office of Epizootics)","The authors undertook a study of environmental and animal risk factors associated with Rift Valley fever (RVF) in south-west Saudi Arabia. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to detect the presence of immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against the RVF virus in serum samples from sentinel animals. In addition, a further 32 known IgM-positive serum samples were tested using the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect the RVF virus genome. The results were analysed using the univariate odds ratio (OR). To control for confounding, Mantel-Haenszel adjusted odds ratio (M-H OR) was used. Positive associations were found between RVF and the following factors: a dense mosquito population (OR = 4.2), high rainfall (M-H OR = 2) and the presence of lakes and/or ponds (M-H OR = 2.2). The RVF virus genome was detected in four (12.5%) serum samples, indicating an early stage of RVF. The study found that the probability of detecting the virus genome was greater in animals with a high percentage of IgM antibodies against the virus (OR = 3) and in animals who had aborted (OR = 4.3). In addition, more sheep than goats tested positive for the presence of the genome (OR = 4). The authors conclude that the environmental and animal risk factors identified in this study can be considered good predictors for RVF and that the animal factors, in particular, should be considered when developing an efficient and cost-effective control strategy."
"Revue scientifique et technique (International Office of Epizootics)","A survey was conducted in the Jazan region of Saudi Arabia to investigate the presence of Rift Valley fever (RVF) in sheep and goats, by clinical identification of suspected herds and detection of immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies to RVF virus. The level of herd immunity was identified by detecting immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies. Rift Valley fever was diagnosed in six out of eight districts included in the survey. Twenty-two animals from 17 herds tested positive for the presence of IgM antibodies against RVF in these districts. The infection rate ranged from 0.12% in the Sabya district to 1.04% in the Jizan district. The level of herd immunity ranged from 22.2% in Jizan to 39.3% in the Alarda district. It can be concluded that the presence of IgM antibodies in clinically suspected herds suggests persistent RVF infection in the Jazan region. Thus, RVF control programmes should be continued to prevent the recurrence of outbreaks in the region and the possible further spread of infection to other regions of Saudi Arabia."
"Annali dell'Istituto superiore di sanità","Over the last century, changes in land-use, modification of agriculture-livestock production systems, disruption of wildlife habitats, increase of human activities, higher frequency of international and intercontinental travels, wider circulation of animals and animal products have contributed to alter the distribution, presence and density of hosts and vectors. As a result, the number of emerging and reemerging diseases, including zoonoses, have greatly increased. Some infectious pathogens, originated in wild animals and/or maintained in sylvatic environments, have become increasingly important worldwide for their impact on wildlife, human health, livestock and agricultural production systems. In this paper, a synthesis of the information available on selected zoonoses of wildlife origin is given, with special reference to sylvatic tick-borne zoonoses in North-western Italy."
"Journal of virology","The Phlebovirus genus (family Bunyaviridae) is composed of a diverse group of arboviruses that cause disease syndromes ranging from mild febrile illness to hemorrhagic fever with high fatality. Although antigenically similar, these viruses differ by approximately 25% at the genome level, and their ecologies, including geographic ranges, preferred vector species, and hosts, vary considerably. In contrast to other ambisense viruses, where RNA hairpin structures which serve as transcription termination signals are frequently found separating the opposite-sense open reading frames, no evidence of predicted high-energy hairpin structures was found at the ambisense junctions of phlebovirus S RNA segments. However, a conserved sequence motif was identified on both negative and ambisense genome segments that functions as a transcription termination signal for the N, NSs, and GPC mRNAs in three diverse phleboviruses, namely, Rift Valley fever, sandfly Sicilian, and Toscana viruses. The exact termination of nascent virus mRNA molecules was determined by 3' rapid amplification of cDNA ends. Surprisingly, analysis of the termini of mRNAs from both S and M segments of these three viruses revealed that transcription termination occurred immediately upstream of a conserved sequence motif with the general features 3'-C(1-3)GUCG/A-5'. In contrast, no corresponding sequence motif was found in the L segments, and analysis indicated a ""runoff"" transcript approach to L mRNA termination. The absolute requirement of the identified transcription termination motif was demonstrated by using a highly efficient Rift Valley fever virus reverse genetics system to generate live recombinant viruses with S segments lacking the termination signal motif for the NP or NSs mRNA and showing that these recombinant viruses generated mRNAs that failed to terminate correctly."
"Tropical medicine & international health : TM & IH","To estimate the prevalence and causes of vitamin A deficiency disorders (VADD) in adult male prisoners in Nakuru, Kenya.A total of 1048 male prisoners aged > or =16 years in Nakuru Government of Kenya prison in Nakuru, Kenya were examined by an ophthalmologist for signs of xerophthalmia. Two hundred and forty-one cases with xerophthalmia and 448 controls randomly selected from the remaining prison population were interviewed about risk factors for xerophthalmia and blood samples were taken to measure serum retinol and haemoglobin.23.6% (95% CI = 21.1-26.3%) of examined inmates showed at least one sign of xerophthalmia, mostly night blindness (98.8% of cases). In the case-control study, the age-adjusted analyses showed that xerophthalmia was associated with age, length of imprisonment and previous imprisonment. Men with xerophthalmia were significantly more likely be in poor health characterised by significant illness, recent hospital admission, persistent cough, diarrhoea, fever or chronic illness. After multivariate adjustment, duration of imprisonment remained strongly associated with xerophthalmia (OR comparing >4 years with <6 months = 20.1, 95% CI = 8.3-48.8). Previous imprisonment, fever, diarrhoea, hospital admission and chronic illness were also significant predictors. Serum retinol levels were significantly lower in cases than controls, while there was no difference in haemoglobin levels.Vitamin A deficiency was a significant public health problem among these Kenyan male prisoners, indicating that it may be important in vulnerable groups other than young children and pregnant or lactating women."
"MMWR. Morbidity and mortality weekly report","In mid-December 2006, several unexplained fatalities associated with fever and generalized bleeding were reported to the Kenya Ministry of Health (KMOH) from Garissa District in North Eastern Province (NEP). By December 20, a total of 11 deaths had been reported. Of serum samples collected from the first 19 patients, Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus RNA or immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies against RVF virus were found in samples from 10 patients; all serum specimens were negative for yellow fever, Ebola, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, and dengue viruses. The outbreak was confirmed by isolation of RVF virus from six of the specimens. Humans can be infected with RVF virus from bites of mosquitoes or other arthropod vectors that have fed on animals infected with RVF virus, or through contact with viremic animals, particularly livestock. Reports of livestock deaths and unexplained animal abortions in NEP provided further evidence of an RVF outbreak. On December 20, an investigation was launched by KMOH, the Kenya Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Program (FELTP), the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI), the Walter Reed Project of the U.S. Army Medical Research Unit, CDC-Kenya's Global Disease Detection Center, and other partners, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF). This report describes the findings from that initial investigation and the control measures taken in response to the RVF outbreak, which spread to multiple additional provinces and districts, resulting in 404 cases with 118 deaths as of January 25, 2007."
"Veterinary microbiology","Following repeated import bans imposed by Saudi Arabia on livestock originated from Somalia due to suspicion of Rift Valley fever (RVF) presence and the severe socio-economic consequences of this, it was imperative for the Somaliland government to carry out surveillance activities in order to determine the status of transboundary diseases in its territory. A GIS computer software (Arcview) was used to overcome the lack of lists of sampling sites due to the high mobility of pastoral nomadic herds in the study area. This method proved very convenient and flexible for the random selection of sampling sites and thus the compliance with the requirements by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) for statistically valid methods if the surveillance outcome is to meet international recognition and acceptance. Screening in Somaliland in 2001 and in Puntland in 2003 which targeted mainly sheep and goats aged 1-2 years (97% of surveyed animals) revealed no signs compatible with the disease but an overall sero-prevalence of 2+/-0.02% (90/4570) and 5+/-0.3% (206/4050), respectively. The spatial distribution showed clusters of high sero-prevalence located mostly in the Nugal Valley. This trend was confirmed by the follow-up survey implemented in Somaliland in 2004 with a herd prevalence of 80+/-6% and a within-herd prevalence up to 50% located again in the Nugal Valley. This result suggests the maintenance and increase of RVF virus activity in the valley. In addition conditions favourable to the breeding and survival of the vector population and the high density of livestock make the Nugal Valley an area of high risk for a RVF outbreak where sentinel herds will be placed."

"The Journal of the Egyptian Public Health Association","Egyptian workers at sewage treatment plants (STPs) work and live in areas, which are highly infested with arthropods. Most of these diseases cause, febrile, influenza like illness, headache, backache, abdominal pain, and fatigue. To determine arboviral etiology in those workers, 264 serum samples were obtained from the workers in four STPs during January and October 1999. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed for immunoglobulins (IgG and IgM), for the detection of West Nile (WN), Sindbis (SIN), Rift Valley fever (RVF), Sandfly Naples (SFN) and Sandfly Sicilian (SFS) viruses. The results showed that (WN) has the highest prevalence (143/264, 54.14%), followed by (SFN) (58/264, 21.97%) then (RVF) (23/264, 7.95%), while, only one recent infection for each of RVF, SFS and SFN (1/264, 0.38%) and 3 persons for SIN viruses.

"International journal of health geographics","El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) related climate anomalies have been shown to have an impact on infectious disease outbreaks. The Climate Prediction Center of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA/CPC) has recently issued an unscheduled El Niño advisory, indicating that warmer than normal sea surface temperatures across the equatorial eastern Pacific may have pronounced impacts on global tropical precipitation patterns extending into the northern hemisphere particularly over North America. Building evidence of the links between ENSO driven climate anomalies and infectious diseases, particularly those transmitted by insects, can allow us to provide improved long range forecasts of an epidemic or epizootic. We describe developing climate anomalies that suggest potential disease risks using satellite generated data.Sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the equatorial east Pacific ocean have anomalously increased significantly during July - October 2006 indicating the typical development of El Niño conditions. The persistence of these conditions will lead to extremes in global-scale climate anomalies as has been observed during similar conditions in the past. Positive Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR) anomalies, indicative of severe drought conditions, have been observed across all of Indonesia, Malaysia and most of the Philippines, which are usually the first areas to experience ENSO-related impacts. This dryness can be expected to continue, on average, for the remainder of 2006 continuing into the early part of 2007. During the period November 2006 - January 2007 climate forecasts indicate that there is a high probability for above normal rainfall in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific Islands, the Korean Peninsula, the U.S. Gulf Coast and Florida, northern South America and equatorial east Africa. Taking into consideration current observations and climate forecast information, indications are that the following regions are at increased risk for disease outbreaks: Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and most of the southeast Asia Islands for increased dengue fever transmission and increased respiratory illness; Coastal Peru, Ecuador, Venezuela, and Colombia for increased risk of malaria; Bangladesh and coastal India for elevated risk of cholera; East Africa for increased risk of a Rift Valley fever outbreak and elevated malaria; southwest USA for increased risk for hantavirus pulmonary syndrome and plague; southern California for increased West Nile virus transmission; and northeast Brazil for increased dengue fever and respiratory illness.The current development of El Niño conditions has significant implications for global public health. Extremes in climate events with above normal rainfall and flooding in some regions and extended drought periods in other regions will occur. Forecasting disease is critical for timely and efficient planning of operational control programs. In this paper we describe developing global climate anomalies that suggest potential disease risks that will give decision makers additional tools to make rational judgments concerning implementation of disease prevention and mitigation strategies."
"Journal of virology","Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus is a mosquito-borne RNA virus responsible for large explosive outbreaks of acute febrile disease in humans and livestock in Africa with significant mortality and economic impact. The successful high-throughput generation of the complete genome sequence was achieved for 33 diverse RVF virus strains collected from throughout Africa and Saudi Arabia from 1944 to 2000, including strains differing in pathogenicity in disease models. While several distinct virus genetic lineages were determined, which approximately correlate with geographic origin, multiple exceptions indicative of long-distance virus movement have been found. Virus strains isolated within an epidemic (e.g., Mauritania, 1987, or Egypt, 1977 to 1978) exhibit little diversity, while those in enzootic settings (e.g., 1970s Zimbabwe) can be highly diverse. In addition, the large Saudi Arabian RVF outbreak in 2000 appears to have involved virus introduction from East Africa, based on the close ancestral relationship of a 1998 East African virus. Virus genetic diversity was low (approximately 5%) and primarily involved accumulation of mutations at an average of 2.9 x 10(-4) substitutions/site/year, although some evidence of RNA segment reassortment was found. Bayesian analysis of current RVF virus genetic diversity places the most recent common ancestor of these viruses in the late 1800s, the colonial period in Africa, a time of dramatic changes in agricultural practices and introduction of nonindigenous livestock breeds. In addition to insights into the evolution and ecology of RVF virus, these genomic data also provide a foundation for the design of molecular detection assays and prototype vaccines useful in combating this important disease."
"Veterinary microbiology","Serodiagnosis of Rift Valley fever (RVF) currently relies on the use of live or inactivated whole virus as antigens. The recombinant nucleocapsid (N) protein of RVF virus was tested for diagnostic applicability in an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (I-ELISA), using sera from experimentally infected sheep (n=128), vaccinated sheep (n=240), and field-collected sera from sheep (n=251), goats (n=362) and cattle (n=100). The N-protein based I-ELISA performed at least as good as VN and HI tests. In goat the diagnostic sensitivity (D-Sn) and specificity (D-Sp) of the I-ELISA was 100% when using the anti-species IgG conjugate. Using protein G as a detection system, the D-Sn and D-Sp in goats were 99.4% and 99.5%, in sheep field sera both 100%, in cattle 100% and 98.3%, respectively. The I-ELISA based on recombinant N-protein has the potential to complement the traditional assays for serodiagnosis of RVF. Advantages of the N-protein are its safety, stability and cost-effectiveness in use and production."
"Tropical medicine & international health : TM & IH","Rift Valley fever is an endemic vector-borne disease in West Africa, which mainly affects domestic ruminants and occasionally humans. The aetiological mechanisms of its endemicity remain under debate. We used a simple spatially explicit model to assess the possibility of endemicity without wild animals providing a permanent virus reservoir. Our model takes into account the vertical transmission in some mosquito species, the rainfall-driven emergence of their eggs and local and distant contacts because of herd migration. Endemicity without such a permanent virus reservoir would be impossible in a single site except when there is a strictly periodic rainfall pattern; but it would be possible when there are herd movements and sufficient inter-site variability in rainfall, which drives mosquito emergence."
"Journal of virological methods","This paper describes the cloning, sequencing and bacterial expression of the N protein of the Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) ZIM688/78 isolate and its evaluation in indirect ELISAs (I-ELISA) for the detection of IgM and IgG antibodies in human and sheep sera. Sera used for the evaluation were from 106 laboratory workers immunised with an inactivated RVF vaccine, 16 RVF patients, 168 serial bleeds from 8 sheep experimentally infected with wild type RVFV and 210 serial bleeds from 10 sheep vaccinated with the live attenuated Smithburn RVFV strain. All human and animal sera that tested positive in the virus neutralisation test were also positive in the IgG I-ELISA. There was a high correlation (R2=0.8571) between virus neutralising titres and IgG I-ELISA readings in human vaccinees. In experimentally infected sheep IgG antibodies were detected from day 4 to 5 post-infection onwards and IgM antibodies from day 3 to 4. The IgG I-ELISA was more sensitive than virus neutralisation and haemagglutination-inhibition tests in detecting the early immune response in experimentally infected sheep. The I-ELISAs demonstrated that the IgG and IgM response to the Smithburn vaccine strain was slower and the levels of antibodies induced markedly lower than to wild type RVFV infection."
"International journal of health geographics","There are few studies that have investigated uncertainties surrounding the scientific community's knowledge of the geographical distribution of major animal diseases. This is particularly relevant to Rift Valley fever (RVF), a zoonotic disease causing destructive outbreaks in livestock and man, as the geographical range of the disease is widening to involve previously unaffected regions. In the current study we investigate the application of methods developed in the decision sciences: multiple criteria decision making using weighted linear combination and ordered weighted averages, and Dempster-Shafer theory, implemented within the geographical information system IDRISI, to obtain a greater understanding of uncertainty related to the geographical distribution of RVF. The focus is on presenting alternate methods where extensive field data are not available and traditional, model-based approaches to disease mapping are impossible to conduct.Using a compensatory multiple criteria decision making model based on weighted linear combination, most of sub-Saharan Africa was suitable for endemic circulation of RVF. In contrast, areas where rivers and lakes traversed semi-arid regions, such as those bordering the Sahara, were highly suitable for RVF epidemics and wet, tropical areas of central Africa had low suitability. Using a moderately non-compensatory model based on ordered weighted averages, the areas considered suitable for endemic and epidemic RVF were more restricted. Varying the relative weights of the different factors in the models did not affect suitability estimates to a large degree, but variations in model structure had a large impact on our suitability estimates. Our Dempster-Shafer analysis supported the belief that a range of semi-arid areas were suitable for RVF epidemics and the plausibility that many other areas of the continent were suitable. Areas where high levels of uncertainty were highlighted included the Ethiopian Highlands, southwest Kenya and parts of West Africa.We have demonstrated the potential of methods developed in the decision sciences to improve our understanding of uncertainties surrounding the geographical distribution of animal diseases, particularly where information is sparse, and encourage wider application of the decision science methodology in the field of animal health."
"Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences","Rift valley fever (RVF) is an arboviral disease produced by a bunyavirus belonging to the genus Phlebovirus. Several species of Aedes and Culex are the vectors of this virus that affects sheep, goats, buffalos, cattle, camels and human beings. The human disease is well known, especially during periods of intense epizootic activity. The initial description of the disease dates back to 1930, when animals and human outbreaks appeared on a farm in Lake Naivasha, in the Great Rift Valley of Kenya. Until 2000, this disease was only described in Africa, and then outbreaks were also declared in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (2000-2001 and 2004) and in Yemen (2000-2001). Animal and human cases were recorded. This work presents a retrospective summary of the data collected on animal RVF cases during this epidemic in Yemen. Results from several RVF surveys were gathered from the Yemeni vet services and FAO experts. Geographical data (topographic maps and data freely available on internet) were used for the location of outbreaks. After cleaning and standardization of location names, all the data were introduced into a GIS database. The spatial distribution of outbreaks was then studied at two scales: at the national level and at a local scale in the particular area of Wadi Mawr in the Tihama plain, Western coast of Yemen."
"Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences","Transboundary animal diseases pose a serious risk to the world animal agriculture and food security and jeopardize international trade. The world has been facing devastating economic losses from major outbreaks of transboundary animal diseases (TADs) such as foot-and-mouth disease, classical swine fever, rinderpest, peste des petits ruminants (PPR), and Rift Valley fever. Lately the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) due to H5N1 virus, has become an international crisis as all regions around the world can be considered at risk. In the past decades, public health authorities within industrialized countries have been faced with an increasing number of food safety issues. The situation is equally serious in developing countries. The globalization of food (and feed) trade, facilitated by the liberalization of world trade, while offering many benefits and opportunities, also represents new risks. The GF-TADs Global Secretariat has carried out several regional consultations for the identification of priority diseases and best ways for their administration, prevention and control. In the questionnaires carried out and through the consultative process, it was noted that globally, FMD was ranked as the first and foremost priority. Rift Valley fever, and today highly pathogenic avian influenza, are defined as major animal diseases which also affect human health. PPR and CBPP, a disease which is particularly serious in Africa and finally, African swine fever (ASF) and classical swine fever (CSF) are also regionally recognised as top priorities on which the Framework is determined to work. The FAO philosophy--shared by the OIE--embraces the need to prevent and control TADs and emerging diseases at their source, which is most of the time in developing countries. Regional and international approaches have to be followed, and the FAO and OIE GF-TADs initiative provides the appropriate concepts and objectives as well as an organizational framework to link international and regional organizations at the service of their countries to better prevent and control the risks on animal and human health and the economic impact of TADs and emerging animal diseases."
"Bulletin de la Société de pathologie exotique (1990)","During the rainy season 2003, an entomological survey was undertaken in the Sahelian bioclimatic zone of the Ferlo area in northern Senegal, in order to evaluate the degree of interaction between Rift valley fever (RVF) virus vectors and domestic animals and to determine the role of natural vertebrate hosts in the transmission and maintenance cycle. The study of vector-host contact was carried out under bed net traps using man, cow, sheep, chicken as bait whereas the RVFV vectors-vertebrate host interactions were studied through the analysis by an ELISA technique of the origin of the blood meals from naturally engorged females collected by aspiration. Blood meals sources were determined using a set of eight antibodies. Overall, the different known RVFV vectors (Culex poicilipes, Aedes vexans and Aedes ochraceus) were opportunistic although the bovine-baited net was, as far the more effective trap with 53.6% of collected mosquitoes. It was followed by the sheep-baited net (16.7%), man-baited net (12.6%) and chicken-baited net (11.6%). The more effectiveness of the bovine-baited net confirms the degree of implication of this host in RVF epidemiology. The study of vector-hosts interactions in nature showed that among the 1,112 mosquito blood meals tested, 701 were identified of which 693 were from Aedes vexans. The percentage of non-reacting blood meal was 36.7% whereas 16.9 % of the blood meals were taken at least on two vertebrate hosts. Overall, 53.2% of the blood meals from Ae. vexans were taken on equine, 18.6% on bovines, 7.1% on sheep and 0.6% on human. No blood meal was taken on rodent. The greatest diversity was observed in August. These host feedings patterns show that although equine is known to play a minor role in RVF epidemiology a thorough attention should be made to this host with regard to the percentage of blood meals taken in this host. The low percentage of blood meals taken on human could probably explain the low human infection rate observed up to now in Senegal. With the high percentage of non-reacting blood meals, our results also underline the necessity of an improvement of ELISA techniques and the use of more reliable tools as molecular markers for an exhaustive identification of vertebrates hosts involved in RVF epidemiological cycle."
"Virology","Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus belongs to the Bunyaviridae family of segmented negative-strand RNA viruses and causes mosquito-borne disease in sub-Saharan Africa. We report the development of a T7 RNA polymerase-driven plasmid-based genetic system for the virulent Egyptian isolate, ZH501. We have used this system to rescue a virus that has a 387 nucleotide deletion on the genomic M segment that eliminates the coding region for two non-structural proteins known as NSm. This virus, DeltaNSm rZH501, is indistinguishable from the parental ZH501 strain with respect to expression of structural proteins and growth in cultured mammalian cells."
"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)","TLR3 was the first member of the TLR family of pattern recognition receptors found to detect a conserved viral molecular pattern, dsRNA, yet supporting evidence for a major role in host defense against viral pathogens is limited. Punta Toro virus (PTV) has been shown to produce severe infection in mice, modeling disease caused by the related highly pathogenic Rift Valley fever phlebovirus in humans and domesticated ungulates. Using TLR3-deficient mice, we investigated the involvement of TLR3 in host defense against PTV infection. Compared with wild-type, TLR3(-/-) mice demonstrate increased resistance to lethal infection and have reduced liver disease associated with hepatotropic PTV infection. Infectious challenge produced comparable peak liver and serum viral loads; however, TLR3(-/-) mice were able to clear systemic virus at a slightly faster rate. Cytokine profiling suggests that TLR3 plays an important role in PTV pathogenesis through the overproduction of inflammatory mediators, which may be central to the observed differences in survival and disease severity. Compared with TLR3-deficient mice, IL-6, MCP-1, IFN-gamma, and RANTES were all present at higher levels in wild-type animals. Most dramatic was the exaggerated levels of IL-6 found systemically and in liver tissue of infected wild-type mice; however, IL-6-deficient animals were found to be more susceptible to lethal PTV infection. Taken together, we conclude that the TLR3-mediated response to PTV infection is detrimental to disease outcome and propose that IL-6, although critical to establishing antiviral defense, contributes to pathogenesis when released in excess, necessitating its controlled production as is seen with TLR3(-/-) mice."
"Journal of virology","Two strains of Punta Toro virus (PTV), isolated from febrile humans in Panama, cause a differential pathogenesis in Syrian hamsters, which could be a useful model for understanding the virulence characteristics and differential outcomes in other phleboviral infections such as Rift Valley fever virus. Genetic reassortants produced between the lethal Adames (A/A/A) and nonlethal Balliet (B/B/B) strains were used in this study to investigate viral genetic determinants for pathogenesis and lethality in the hamster model. The S segment was revealed to be a critical genome segment, determining lethality with log(10) 50% lethal doses for each PTV genotype as follows (L/M/S convention): A/A/A, <0.7; B/A/A, <0.7; A/B/A, 1.5; B/B/A, 2.2; B/A/B, 4.7; A/B/B, >4.7; A/A/B, >4.7; B/B/B, >4.7. In addition, the Adames strain inhibits the induction of alpha/beta interferon (IFN-alpha/beta) in vivo and in vitro and inhibits the activation of the IFN-beta promoter. Expression of the PTV Adames NSs protein, encoded by the S RNA segment, inhibited the virus-mediated induction of an IFN-beta promoter-driven reporter gene, suggesting that PTV NSs functions as a type I IFN antagonist. Taken together, these data indicate a mechanism of pathogenesis in which the suppression of the type I IFN response early during PTV infection leads to early and uncontrolled viral replication and, ultimately, hamster death. This study contributes to our understanding of Phlebovirus pathogenesis and identifies potential targets for immune modulation to increase host survival."
"Virology","The genomic M RNA segment of Rift Valley fever virus is transcribed to produce a single mRNA with multiple translation initiation sites. The products of translation are an N-terminal nested series of polyproteins. These polyproteins enter the secretory system of the host cell and are proteolytically processed to yield the mature virion glycoproteins, Gn and Gc, and two non-structural glycoproteins. By means of pulse-chase immune precipitation experiments we identify the Gn and Gc precursor molecules and also show that signal peptidase cleavage is required for mature Gn and Gc production. We also demonstrate that a hydrophobic domain at the N-terminus of Gn acts as a signal peptide only in the context of the polyprotein precursors that initiate at the second, fourth or fifth AUGs. In addition, we document that formation of Gn/Gc heteromeric complexes occur rapidly (<5 min) and can occur prior to signal peptidase processing of Gn, suggesting that this complex forms in the endoplasmic reticulum. Interestingly, Gc can form a complex with a glycoprotein that has been considered nonstructural, a discovery that has implications for both the topology and potential packaging of this glycoprotein."
"Virology","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), a member of the Phlebovirus genus in the Bunyaviridae family, is transmitted by mosquitoes and infects both humans and domestic animals, particularly cattle and sheep. Since primary RVFV strains must be handled in BSL-3+ or BSL-4 facilities, a RVFV cell-cell fusion assay will facilitate the investigation of RVFV glycoprotein function under BSL-2 conditions. As for other members of the Bunyaviridae family, RVFV glycoproteins are targeted to the Golgi, where the virus buds, and are not efficiently delivered to the cell surface. However, overexpression of RVFV glycoproteins using an alphavirus replicon vector resulted in the expression of the glycoproteins on the surface of multiple cell types. Brief treatment of RVFV glycoprotein expressing cells with mildly acidic media (pH 6.2 and below) resulted in rapid and efficient syncytia formation, which we quantified by beta-galactosidase alpha-complementation. Fusion was observed with several cell types, suggesting that the receptor(s) for RVFV is widely expressed or that this acid-dependent virus does not require a specific receptor to mediate cell-cell fusion. Fusion occurred over a broad temperature range, as expected for a virus with both mosquito and mammalian hosts. In contrast to cell fusion mediated by the VSV-G glycoprotein, RVFV glycoprotein-dependent cell fusion could be prevented by treating target cells with trypsin, indicating that one or more proteins (or protein-associated carbohydrate) on the host cell surface are needed to support membrane fusion. The cell-cell fusion assay reported here will make it possible to study the membrane fusion activity of RVFV glycoproteins in a high-throughput format and to screen small molecule inhibitors for the ability to block virus-specific membrane fusion."
"Annals of tropical paediatrics","Rift Valley Fever (RVF) is a viral disease transmitted to humans by mosquito bite and contact with animals or their infected tissues. Other modes of transmission include aerosol inhalation and possibly ingestion of raw milk from infected animals. We present a 5-day-old neonate with fatal RVF. Onset of the infant's illness on the 2nd day of life combined with positive RVF-IgM and serological evidence of maternal disease supports vertical transmission."
"Journal of theoretical biology","Inspired by Davidson method of estimating daily survivals of a structureless population of mosquitoes, we present a model which describes the behavior of floodwater mosquitoes in terms of emergence functions following a rainfall event, blood feeding frequency and parous stages, and survival at various stages. As a generalization of the Davidson formula, we have developed an approach for dealing with the dynamics of structured population of mosquitoes, and derived various formulas allowing assessment of demographic parameters like durations of gonotrophic cycles and (apparent) daily survivals. The method was subsequently applied to field data of floodwater mosquitoes Aedes vexans arabiensis, potential vectors of Rift Valley fever in West Africa, collected during the 2003 rainy season in Barkedji, Senegal. We found that mosquitoes emerged about 3 to 4 days following an efficient rainfall, and mosquito emergences, described by a bell shaped function, lasted for about 2 days. The mean duration of the gonotrophic cycle was 3 days and the apparent daily survival about 0.87."
"Journal of virology","Rift Valley fever viruses carrying mutations of the M gene preglycoprotein region, one lacking NSm protein expression, one lacking 78-kDa protein expression, and one lacking expression of both proteins, were compared in cell culture. All of the mutants and their parent virus produced plaques with similar sizes and morphologies in Vero E6 cells and had similar growth kinetics in Vero, C6/36, and MRC5 cells, demonstrating that the NSm and 78-kDa proteins were not needed for the virus to replicate efficiently in cell culture. A competition-propagation assay revealed that the parental virus was slightly more fit than the mutant virus lacking expression of both proteins."
"Vaccine","The glycoprotein (GP) and nucleocapsid (NC) genes of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) were expressed in different expression systems and were evaluated for their ability to protect mice from virulent challenge using a prime-boost regime. Mice vaccinated with a lumpy skin disease virus-vectored recombinant vaccine (rLSDV-RVFV) expressing the two RVFV glycoproteins (G1 and G2) developed neutralising antibodies and were fully protected when challenged, as were those vaccinated with a crude extract of truncated G2 glycoprotein (tG2). By contrast mice vaccinated with a DNA vaccine expressing G1 and G2 did not sero-convert with only 20% of them surviving challenge. Mice vaccinated with the DNA vaccine and boosted with rLSDV-RVFV also failed to sero-convert but 40% survived challenge. Surprisingly, although none of the mice immunised with the purified NC protein sero-converted, 60% of them survived virulent challenge. The rLSDV-RVFV construct was then further evaluated in sheep for its dual protective abilities against RVFV and sheeppox virus (SPV). Vaccinated sheep sero-converted for both viruses and were protected against RVFV challenge, however, neither the immunised or negative control animals showed any significant reactions to the virulent SPV challenge."
"Revue scientifique et technique (International Office of Epizootics)","Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a zoonotic disease that affects both humans and domestic animals. In humans, it can cause a fatal haemorrhagic fever disease. When domestic animals such as sheep, goats, camels and cattle are infected, the infection may or may not be accompanied by clinical signs of disease. Both sub-clinical and clinically affected animals present a hazard as a source of infection for humans. The risk of infection is greatest at the time of killing, when aerosols of infected blood may be generated, particularly by traditional sacrificial slaughtering practices. Every year some 10 million to 15 million small ruminants may be slaughtered during the religious festivals at Mecca. Some of these animals come from the Arabian Peninsula itself, but most are imported across the Red Sea, from countries in East Africa and the Horn of Africa, where RVF is known to be enzootic and can be greatly amplified during periods of epizootic virus activity. These animals may be transported to and arrive in Mecca within the incubation period for the disease. Rift Valley fever is also known to occur in the tihama zones of both Saudi Arabia and Yemen."

"Emerging infectious diseases","Arboviruses have evolved a number of strategies to survive environmental challenges. This review examines the factors that may determine arbovirus emergence, provides examples of arboviruses that have emerged into new habitats, reviews the arbovirus situation in western Europe in detail, discusses potential arthropod vectors, and attempts to predict the risk for arbovirus emergence in the United Kingdom. We conclude that climate change is probably the most important requirement for the emergence of arthropodborne diseases such as dengue fever, yellow fever, Rift Valley fever, Japanese encephalitis, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, bluetongue, and African horse sickness in the United Kingdom. While other arboviruses, such as West Nile virus, Sindbis virus, Tahyna virus, and Louping ill virus, apparently circulate in the United Kingdom, they do not appear to present an imminent threat to humans or animals."
"Medical hypotheses","Yellow fever is an acute infectious, non-contagious disease characterized by intense vasculopathy and lesions in different organs. In the liver, one of the main targets of the virus, the infection induces a characteristic midzonal injury characterized by hepatocyte necrosis, apoptosis and steatosis. This characteristics pattern of liver injury in yellow fever is also observed in conditions of low-flow hypoxia and other infections such as dengue and Rift Valley fever. There are no reports in the literature explaining the genesis of this peculiar histopathological pattern in yellow fever. Some hypotheses have been proposed to explain the mechanism of this midzonal distribution pattern observed in the liver such as low-flow hypoxia and tropism of the virus toward hepatocytes in this area. These hypotheses are discussed in view of more recent findings regarding the pathogenesis of yellow fever and regarding hepatic physiopathology, and a new hypothesis is proposed: the midzonal necrosis is consequence of action of combined factors mainly the direct cytopathic effect of YFV associated with a potent immune response in which CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes and the cytokines, especially TGF-beta, but also TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma play an important role."
"Virology","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) (Phlebovirus, Bunyaviridae) possesses a genome composed of three negative-stranded RNA molecules. Each segment contains 3' and 5' noncoding regions with terminal complementary sequences forming a panhandle structure. We showed that transcription-replication of the L, M and S segments is regulated, and we established a minigenome rescue system expressing a CAT reporter to investigate the role of the noncoding regions in this process. The L, M and S segment-based minigenomes were shown to drive bona fide transcription and replication and to express variable levels of CAT reporter, indicating differential promoter activities within the noncoding sequences. In addition, we found a good correlation between the relative promoter strength and the abundance of viral RNA species in RVFV-infected cells. Altogether, these results show that RVFV minigenomes are powerful tools to study transcription and replication and constitute a valuable basis to rescue infectious virus from cDNAs."
"Journal of medical virology","Three hundred eighteen European cows and 115 buffaloes were vaccinated with locally prepared Smithburn vaccine, of which, 100 cows and 20 buffaloes were pregnant. Twenty-eight cows aborted within 72 days post-vaccination, buffaloes did not abort. Blood samples collected 77 days post-vaccination from aborted cows, 17 pregnant cows, 5 pregnant buffaloes, and 32 non-pregnant cows. Sera were tested by ELISA for anti-RVF IgM and IgG. All aborted cows were strongly positive for IgG. Five of 17 cows and two of five buffaloes that did not abort were IgG positive. The percentage of IgM positives in aborted cows was 25% and 0% in non-aborted cows. The percentage of IgG positives in pregnant non-aborted cows was lower than in non-pregnant cows. The percentage of IgG positives of non-pregnant cows was lower than pregnant aborted cows. Virus was isolated from one aborted fetus. The nucleotide sequence of fetus virus was compared to Smithburn of Onderstepoort, local Smithburn and virus isolates from 1993 to 1994 and 1977 RVF outbreaks. The nucleotide sequences of Onderstepoort and Egyptian Smithburn vaccines were almost identical. The sequences of 1993-1994 isolates were identical to 1977 outbreak virus. Virus from the fetus had two mutations; it is apparently a variant that is genetically distant from local Smithburn and Onderstepoort vaccines. Fetus virus was genetically distant from virus of 1993/1994 and 1977 outbreaks. In conclusion, antibody response to vaccination with local Smithburn had occurred in some, but not all the cows and buffaloes. Virus isolation from the fetus suggests in utero transmission of used vaccine virus, which resulted in high abortions in European cows."
"The Southeast Asian journal of tropical medicine and public health","In 1998, circulation of the Rift Valley Fever (RVF) virus was revealed in Diawara by detection of IgM antibodies in sheep and isolation of the virus from mosquitoes caught outside a village. A seroprevalence study was carried out. Finger-prick blood samples, individual and collective details were obtained. One thousand five hundred twenty people (6 months - 83 years) were included. Overall prevalence in this group was approximately 5.2%. The prevalence in infants (6 months - 2 years) was 8.5%. Age, gender, contact with a pond, presence of sheep, and abortion among sheep, and individual or collective travel history were not statistically associated with prevalence. Prevalence increased significantly when the distance to a small ravine, located in the middle of the village, decreased. The results suggest a low, recent, not endemic circulation of the virus. Culex quinquefasciatus was captured near the ravine. This mosquito, similar to Culex pipiens, can play a similar role in human-to-human transmission of the RVF virus."
"Meditsinskaia parazitologiia i parazitarnye bolezni","A great body of data on the fauna and ecology of wild mammals and their participation in the circulation of arboviruses were collected when the ecology of the latter of the Republic of Guinea was studied in 1978 to 1989. A hundred and eighteen species belonging to 10 orders were identified. Over 2,000 biological specimens were virologically and serologically examined. Six arboviruses were isolated. These included Dugbe virus (from the hussar monkey Cercopithecus (Erythrocebus patas) and 5 viruses from chiropters: Rift valley fever, from Micropteropus pusillus, Miniopterus schreibersi, and Hipposideros caffer, Saboya, Fomede, and Ank 6909 from Nycteris gambiensis and Kolenter from Hipposideros sp. Fomede, Kolente, and Ank 6909 viruses turned out to be new species for science. Rodents were found to have viral antigens of Lass fever (Mastomys natalensis, Tatera valida kempi and Rattus rattus), Dugbe and Chikungunya fevers (M. natalensis) and West Nile fever (Mus sp.). A serological survey of mammals revealed that the latter had antibodies to 12 arboviruses. Thus, the mammals of Guinea participate in the circulation of 18 arboviruses, 13 of them are pathogenic for man."
"Journal of virology","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) (genus Phlebovirus, family Bunyaviridae) has a tripartite negative-strand genome, causes a mosquito-borne disease that is endemic in sub-Saharan African countries and that also causes large epidemics among humans and livestock. Furthermore, it is a bioterrorist threat and poses a risk for introduction to other areas. In spite of its danger, neither veterinary nor human vaccines are available. We established a T7 RNA polymerase-driven reverse genetics system to rescue infectious clones of RVFV MP-12 strain entirely from cDNA, the first for any phlebovirus. Expression of viral structural proteins from the protein expression plasmids was not required for virus rescue, whereas NSs protein expression abolished virus rescue. Mutants of MP-12 partially or completely lacking the NSs open reading frame were viable. These NSs deletion mutants replicated efficiently in Vero and 293 cells, but not in MRC-5 cells. In the latter cell line, accumulation of beta interferon mRNA occurred after infection by these NSs deletion mutants, but not after infection by MP-12. The NSs deletion mutants formed larger plaques than MP-12 did in Vero E6 cells and failed to shut off host protein synthesis in Vero cells. An MP-12 mutant carrying a luciferase gene in place of the NSs gene replicated as efficiently as MP-12 did, produced enzymatically active luciferase during replication, and stably retained the luciferase gene after 10 virus passages, representing the first demonstration of foreign gene expression in any bunyavirus. This reverse genetics system can be used to study the molecular virology of RVFV, assess current vaccine candidates, produce new vaccines, and incorporate marker genes into animal vaccines."

"Current molecular medicine","Rift Valley fever is considered to be one of the most important viral zoonoses in Africa. In 2000, the Rift valley fever virus spread to the Arabian Peninsula and caused two simultaneous outbreaks in Yemen and Saudi Arabia. It is transmitted to ruminants and to humans by mosquitoes. The viral agent is an arbovirus, which belongs to the Phlebovirus genus in the Bunyaviridae family. This family of viruses comprises more than 300 members grouped into five genera: Orthobunyavirus, Phlebovirus, Hantavirus, Nairovirus, and Tospovirus. Several members of the Bunyaviridae family are responsible for fatal hemorrhagic fevers: Rift Valley fever virus (Phlebovirus), Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (Nairovirus), Hantaan, Sin Nombre and related viruses (Hantavirus), and recently Garissa, now identified as Ngari virus (Orthobunyavirus). Here are reviewed recent advances in Rift Valley fever virus, its epidemiology, molecular biology and focus on recent data on the interactions between viral and cellular proteins, which help to understand the molecular mechanisms utilized by the virus to circumvent the host cellular response."
"Nihon rinsho. Japanese journal of clinical medicine","Rift Valley fever is transmitted by mosquito bites. The causative agent was isolated in 1931 from an infected sheep in Kenya's Rift Valley. In east Africa, outbreaks usually occur every 5 to 10 years, probably due to movement of the inter-tropical convergence zone. The many shallow depressions, ""dambos"" in east and southern Africa, filled with water during the rainy season are the main habitat for mosquito larva. Rift Valley fever was confined to the South of the Sahara until 1977 when a big outbreak occurred in Egypt. One of the factors believed responsible for the outbreak was the abundant water supply from canals of the newly constructed (Aswan? ) dam."
"Journal of medical entomology","The dispersal, population dynamics, and age structure of two Rift Valley Fever Virus (Phlebovirus: Bunyaviridae) (RVFV) vectors, Aedes vexans Meigen and Culex poicilipes Theobald, were investigated in northern Senegal. The main objective was to investigate possible factors that mediate RVFV emergence and propagation at a site where humans and livestock live in proximity to temporary surface pools. In mark-release-recapture studies, recapture rates of 0.18% (156/85,500) and 3.46% (201/5,800) were obtained for Ae. vexans and Cx. poicilipes, respectively. The number of mosquitoes recaptured decreased with increasing distance from the release point and over time. The estimated daily survival rate for released females ranged from 91 to 96% for Ae. vexans and 70-79% for Cx. poicilipes. The maximum time after release when marked mosquitoes were collected was 23 and 12 d for Ae. vexans and Cx. poicilipes, respectively. The maximum distances from the release point that marked females were recaptured was 620 and 550 m for Ae vexans and Cx. poicilipes, respectively. Rainfall periodicity was a key factor controlling Ae. vexans population abundance. In contrast, rainfall had no discernible effect on the fluctuation of Cx. poicilipes numbers. The involvement of these two species in the transmission of RVFV is discussed with respect to their longevity and daily survival rate."
"Archives of virology. Supplementum","Etiologic agents of arboviral diseases are primarily zoonotic pathogens that are maintained in nature in cycles involving arthropod transmission among a variety of susceptible reservoir hosts. In the simplest form of human exposure, spillover occurs from the enzootic cycle when humans enter zoonotic foci and/or enzootic amplification increases circulation near humans. Examples include Eastern (EEEV) and Western equine encephalitis viruses (WEEV), as well as West Nile (WNV), St. Louis encephalitis (SLEV) and Yellow fever viruses. Spillover can involve direct transmission to humans by primary enzootic vectors (e.g. WNV, SLEV and WEEV) and/or bridge vectors with more catholic feeding preferences that include humans (e.g. EEEV). Some viruses, such as Rift Valley fever, Japanese encephalitis and Venezuelan equine encephalitis viruses (VEEV) undergo secondary amplification involving replication in livestock animals, resulting in greater levels of spillover to humans in rural settings. In the case of VEEV, secondary amplification involves equines and requires adaptive mutations in enzootic strains that allow for efficient viremia production. Two of the most important human arboviral pathogens, Yellow fever and dengue viruses (DENV), have gone one step further and adopted humans as their amplification hosts, allowing for urban disease. The ancestral forms of DENV, sylvatic viruses transmitted among nonhuman primate reservoir hosts by arboreal mosquitoes, adapted to efficiently infect the urban mosquito vectors Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus during the past few thousand years as civilizations arose. Comparative studies of the sylvatic and urban forms of DENV may elucidate the evolution of arboviral virulence and the prospects for DENV eradication should effective vaccines be implemented."
"Archives of virology. Supplementum","Knowledge of the fate of an arbovirus in a mosquito is fundamental to understanding the mosquito's competence to transmit the virus. When a competent mosquito ingests viremic vertebrate blood, virus infects midgut epithelial cells and replicates, then disseminates to other tissues, including salivary glands and/or ovaries. The virus is then transmitted to the next vertebrate host horizontally via bite and/or vertically to the mosquito's offspring. Not all mosquitoes that ingest virus become infected or, if infected, transmit virus. Several ""barriers"" to arbovirus passage, and ultimately transmission, have been identified in incompetent or partially competent mosquitoes, including, among others, gut escape barriers and salivary gland infection barriers. The extra-cellular basal lamina around the midgut epithelium and the basal lamina that surrounds the salivary glands may act as such barriers. Midgut basal lamina pore sizes are significantly smaller than arboviruses and ultrastructural evidence suggests that midgut tracheae and tracheoles may provide a means for viruses to circumvent this barrier. Further, immunocytochemical evidence indicates the existence of a salivary gland infection barrier in Anopheles stephensi. The basal lamina may prevent access to mosquito cell surface virus receptors and help explain why anopheline mosquitoes are relatively incompetent arbovirus transmitters when compared to culicines."
"Emerging infectious diseases","During the 2003 rainy season, the clinical and serologic incidence of Rift Valley fever was assessed in small ruminant herds living around temporary ponds located in the semi-arid region of the Ferlo, Senegal. No outbreak was detected by the surveillance system. Serologic incidence was estimated at 2.9% (95% confidence interval 1.0-8.7) and occurred in 5 of 7 ponds with large variations in the observed incidence rate (0%-20.3%). The location of ponds in the Ferlo Valley and small ponds were correlated with higher serologic incidence (p = 0.0005 and p = 0.005, respectively). Rift Valley fever surveillance should be improved to allow early detection of virus activity. Ruminant vaccination programs should be prepared to confront the foreseeable higher risks for future epidemics of this disease."
"The American journal of pathology","Experimental infection of hamsters with Punta Toro virus (PTV) produces a disease with clinical and pathological similarities to the severe human hemorrhagic fever caused by Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), thus providing an animal model for RVFV pathogenesis. In this model, hepatocytic apoptosis is the main pathological component of liver injuries that are responsible for severe hemorrhagic manifestations. To further elucidate whether viral replication in hepatocytes directly causes apoptosis, we studied the morphological and biochemical changes of apoptosis in HepG2 cells at different time points after PTV infection. Cellular viability began to decrease 12 hours after infection compared with controls. Caspases 3/7 were activated significantly at 48 and 72 hours after infection, and phosphatidylserine translocation and DNA fragmentation were also detected at 48 and 72 hours. Cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry showed that infected HepG2 cells were arrested at G(0)/G(1) phase. Furthermore, virus titer increased with apoptosis progression, suggesting that viral replication is necessary for the apoptotic process. These results indicate that PTV infection alone, without a secondary inflammatory cellular reaction, induces hepatocytic apoptosis and suggest that future therapeutics for RVFV hemorrhagic disease might target inhibition of cellular apoptotic pathways during the acute infection."
"Vaccine","DNA vaccines for Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), and Hantaan virus (HTNV), were tested in mice alone or in various combinations. The bunyavirus vaccines (RVFV, CCHFV, and HTNV) expressed Gn and Gc genes, and the flavivirus vaccine (TBEV) expressed the preM and E genes. All vaccines were delivered by gene gun. The TBEV DNA vaccine and the RVFV DNA vaccine elicited similar levels of antibodies and protected mice from challenge when delivered alone or in combination with other DNAs. Although in general, the HTNV and CCHFV DNA vaccines were not very immunogenic in mice, there were no major differences in performance when given alone or in combination with the other vaccines."
"East African medical journal","To investigate the epidemiology of falciparum malaria in workers from a highland tea plantation in western Kenya with very seasonally limited malaria transmission to determine what factors are associated with increased risk of malaria transmission in the Kenyan highlands.A cross-sectional study with rolling, random subject enrollment from April 1998 through October 1999.Highland tea plantation located at 0 degrees 22' south and 35' 17' east in the Rift Valley highlands of western Kenya, an area with seasonally limited malaria transmission.The data for the study were obtained from enrollment of outpatients from the healthcare system of a major tea company, which has 18 estates with 22,000 workers and approximately 50,000 persons eligible for health care. Of the 2796 patients evaluated during the study period, 798 cases of malaria were confirmed by positive peripheral blood smear; 1998 smear-negative patients were pressured to be non-infected and served as controls (Ratio: 2.52: 1).Tea estate workers do not receive malaria chemoprophylaxis, but were given easily available free treatment for any symptomatic infections.Smear-positive cases were compared with smear-negative patients for multiple demographic and disease variables, including sex, age, travel history, ethnic origin, home district transmission risk index and length of residence. Disease characteristics, including parasite types, counts and clinical symptoms, and treatments administered were described.Malaria was predominantly P. falciparum (>99%); asexual parasite counts ranged from 1-10,440 per mm3, with a mean of 803.6 (95% confidence interval: 695.2, 912.0). Gametocytemia was present in 7.5% of smear-positive malaria cases, but was rare in the absence of blood asexual forms (0.5%). Prior use of a variety of antimalarial drugs was extremely common and negatively predictive of parasitemia in patients presenting for clinical treatment (Pearson Chi-square 50.81, p < 0.001), as was a subjective history of previous malaria infection in the past year (F = 26.65, 14 df, p < 0.001; univariate ANOVA). Amodiaquine was the most commonly used drug to treat cases of either smear-proven or clinically suspected malaria, accounting for 56% of therapy; pyrimethamine/sulfadoxine was used to treat 27%, artemesinin 8% and chloroquine was administered to only 3%, while combination therapy was used in 5% of cases, and only a single treatment (0.1 %) was recorded using quinine. Subjects with a prior history of treatment for malaria were statistically less likely to be infected again (Pearson Chi-square 50.81, p < 0.001). Presenting with symptoms suggestive of malaria was statistically associated with parasitemia, particularly fever, headache and dizziness, (p <0.001 for all, univariate ANOVA), but in general, clinical symptoms were not an effective discriminator of malarial disease. Ethnic group predicted malaria infection with groups traditionally from the Lake Victoria lowland regions having a greater prevalence of parasitemia (F = 2.04, 4. df, p = 0.002, univariate ANOVA). Parasitemia was significantly associated with age less than ten years (Pearson Chi-Square 145.99, p < 0.001), with a history of travel more than twenty kilometers from site within six weeks (Pearson Chi-square 58.28, p < 0.001) and with time since arrival on the plantation of one year or less (Pearson Chi-square 185.12, p <0.001)Lower infection rates in persons with a history of prior infection implies a protective effect; the predilection of malaria for young and immunologically naive victims was confirmed. The proclivity in some ethnic groups for travel to holoendemic areas also accounts for the strong associations between recent travel, lowland ethnic group and infection. These findings taken together suggest that importation of malaria to the highlands, as well as travel away from the highlands, are important sources of new infections among persons living and working there."
"Journal of virology","Analysis of purified Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) particles demonstrated the presence of three negative-sense RNA genomes, plus three anti-viral-sense RNA segments. The virion-associated anti-viral-sense S segment served as a template for the synthesis of NSs mRNA immediately after infection. NSs protein synthesis also occurred early in infection, suggesting that NSs protein produced early in infection probably has biologically significant roles in virus replication and/or survival in the host. Translation inhibitor treatment of mammalian cells infected with viruses belonging to the Bunyaviridae family generally inhibits viral mRNA synthesis. However, RVFV NSs mRNA synthesis, but not N mRNA synthesis, was resistant to puromycin treatment during primary transcription, pointing to the uniqueness of RVFV NSs mRNA synthesis."
"Journal of virology","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a Phlebovirus in the Bunyaviridae family. The nucleoprotein N is the most abundant component of the virion; numerous copies of N associate with the viral RNA genome and form pseudohelicoidal ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) circularized by a panhandle structure formed by the base-paired RNA sequences at the 3' and 5' termini. These structures play a central role in transcription and replication. We investigated the intermolecular interactions of the RVFV N protein and found that after chemical cross-linking treatment, the nucleoprotein from purified RNPs migrates mainly as dimers. The N-N interaction was studied using the yeast two-hybrid system, the GST pull-down method, and mutational analysis. We demonstrated that the N terminus from residue 1 to 71, and particularly Tyr 4 and Phe 11, which are conserved among phlebovirus N sequences, are involved in the interaction. The C-terminal region did not seem to be essential for the N-N interaction. Moreover, we showed that N(TOS), the N protein of the related Toscana phlebovirus, interacts with itself and forms heterodimers with N(RVF), suggesting that the dimeric form of N may be a conserved feature in phlebovirus RNPs."
"Journal of virological methods","This paper describes the production and characterization of RVFV monoclonal antibodies. The characteristics of 32 out of 55 ELISA and/or IFA positive monoclonal antibodies were determined, including the RVFV components against which they are directed. One monoclonal antibody recognized the nucleoprotein, 15 the Gc and 16 the Gn. Among the latter ones, five monoclonal antibodies possess another specificity and recognized both Gn and either the nucleoprotein (four of them) or the NSs protein (one). To validate the use of these monoclonal antibodies for diagnosis tests, a pool of monoclonal antibodies reacting with the structural proteins was prepared and used successfully to detect RVFV from cell culture as well as viral antigen-antibody complex in ELISA."
"The Journal of infection","Four patients with typical acute viral hemorrhagic fever were identified in the holy city of Makkah, Saudi Arabia, between 8 and 23 February 2001, the Hajj (pilgrimage) period of that year. Tests for Rift Valley fever (RVF), Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), and dengue were negative. Blood specimens were sent to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta for viral culture and testing for other hemorrhagic fever viruses. A new flavivirus closely related to the tick-borne Kyasanur forest disease virus was isolated. This new flavivirus was originally isolated in 1995 from 6 patients with dengue-like hemorrhagic fever from Alkhumra district, south of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.A case definition was formulated for surveillance of this new disease in Saudi Arabia. Blood specimens were collected from all patients with suspect 'Alkhumra' virus (ALKV) infection and tested for ALKV, RVF, CCHF, dengue, and West Nile encephalitis. Patients data were prospectively collected on standardized data collection forms.From 8 February 2001 through 9 February 2003, a total of 37 cases were identified in Makkah, 20 of them were laboratory confirmed. Acute febrile flu-like illness with hepatitis (100%), hemorrhagic manifestations (55%), and encephalitis (20%) were the main clinical features. The case fatality was 25%. The disease seemed to be transmitted from sheep or goat to humans by the mosquito bites or direct contact with these animals.ALKV infection is a novel serious zoonotic hemorrhagic fever virus discovered in Saudi Arabia. The role of arthropods such as ticks and mosquitoes, and animals such as sheep, goat, and rodents in the transmission and maintenance of the virus remains to be elucidated."
"Journal of vector ecology : journal of the Society for Vector Ecology","The importance of rainfall for the development of Aedes vexans arabiensis populations, one of the potential vectors of Rift Valley Fever in West Africa, was demonstrated in a two-year follow-up study conducted in the Ferlo region of Senegal. In 2003, the rainy season began with heavy rains and, as a result, temporary ponds, the breeding places for mosquitoes, were flooded at their maximum level immediately. In such conditions, Aedes vexans arabiensis populations are abundant at the very beginning of the season, when the majority of eggs in quiescence are flooded. Females, hatching from eggs laid the year before, quickly lay eggs on the pond's wet soil, which will undergo dormancy as the water level goes down. Rainless periods longer than seven days, the time needed for embryogenesis, followed by significant rainfall, will result in the hatching of very large numbers of new eggs. Thus, several generations of adults may exist during the same rainy season. Because of potential vertical transmission of Rift Valley Fever virus in Aedes species, viral transmission and disease risk can appear as early as the beginning of the rainy season and if late rains occur, at the end of the season. This dynamic maximizes the virus' chance to persist from one year to another, thus facilitating endemisation of Rift Valley Fever in areas where Aedes vexans arabiensis exists."

Formulated in a 5% vanishing cream as Aldara, this self-applied therapy has shown good efficacy and safety in the treatment of external genital and perianal warts caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection (Condyloma acuminata). The molecule does not demonstrate direct antiviral activity, but through induction of cytokines results in immune-based resolution of wart tissue and reduction of viral burden. Phase III trials of imiquimod have demonstrated that patients who experience complete clearance of either new or recalcitrant warts tend to remain clear, possibly related to Th1 immune recognition and memory. Self-application, good tolerability and a unique mechanism of action combine to make imiquimod a reasonable first-line therapy for genital warts. The effects of imiquimod on immune function suggest several potential uses. Preclinical studies of infection with herpes simplex virus (HSV), cutaneous leishmaniasis, Rift Valley Fever virus and vesiculostomatitis virus have shown reduced viral persistence, reduced recurrence (HSV) and diminished pathology (Leishmania donovani). In a murine tumour model using the FCB bladder cancer cell line, imiquimod behaves as a potent adjuvant leading to immune-based tumour cell eradication and immunity against subsequent FCB cell challenge. The ability of imiquimod to induce significant production of interferon alpha (IFN-alpha) by monocytes/macrophages suggests that diseases responsive to recombinant interferon therapy, such as basal cell carcinoma, may be reasonable clinical targets. The induction of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) and interleukin-12 (IL-12) leads to inhibition of IL-5, with animal models demonstrating immune deviation away from Th2 immune responses. The observation that several patients with hepatitis C infection and eosinophilia showed normalisation of elevated eosinophil counts in association with oral imiquimod therapy encourages further exploration of the immune modifying properties of this novel molecule. This review is focused on the use of imiquimod for the treatment of external genital and perianal warts."
"Medical and veterinary entomology","Following an outbreak of Rift Valley fever (RVF) in south-eastern Mauritania during 1998, entomological investigations were conducted for 2 years in the affected parts of Senegal and Mauritania, spanning the Sénégal River basin. A total of 92 787 mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae), belonging to 10 genera and 41 species, were captured in light traps. In Senegal, Culex poicilipes (41%) and Mansonia uniformis (39%) were the most abundant species caught, whereas Aedes vexans (77%) and Cx. poicilipes (15%) predominated in Mauritania. RVF virus was isolated from 63 pools of Cx. poicilipes: 36 from Senegal in 1998 and 27 from Mauritania in 1999. These results are the first field evidence of Cx. poicilipes naturally infected with RVFV, and the first isolations of this virus from mosquitoes in Mauritania - the main West African epidemic and epizootic area. Additional arbovirus isolates comprised 25 strains of Bagaza (BAG) from Aedes fowleri, Culex neavei and Cx. poicilipes; 67 Sanar (ArD 66707) from Cx. poicilipes; 51 Wesselsbron (WSL) from Ae. vexans and 30 strains of West Nile (WN) from Ma. uniformis, showing differential specific virus-vector associations in the circulation activity of these five arboviruses."
"Revista española de salud pública","Due to Spain's being located near Africa, being a stopping-off point for migrating birds and individuals and due to its climate conditions, nearing those of areas where there are vector-borne diseases, this is a country where this type of diseases could taken on greater importance due to the climate change. The possible risk would result from the geographical spread of already established vectors or due to subtropical vectors adapted to surviving in cooler, dried climates being imported and taking up residence. Hypothetically, the vector-borne diseases subject to be influenced by the climate change in Spain would be those transmitted by dipterans, such as dengue fever, West Nile encephalitis, Rift Valley fever, malaria and leishmaniasis; tick-transmitted diseases, such as Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, tick-borne encephalitis, Lyme disease, spotted fever and endemic relapsing fever; and rodent-transmitted diseases. But the greatest, most viable threat would be the Aedes albopictus mosquito, which would be capable of transmitting viral diseases such as West Nile encephalitis or dengue fever, taking up residence. But, for actual areas of endemia being established, a combination of other factors, such as the massive, simultaneous influx of animal or human reservoirs and the deterioration of the social healthcare conditions and of the Public Health services."
"Journal of virological methods","This paper describes the development and validation of an inhibition ELISA based on gamma-irradiated tissue culture-derived antigen for the detection of antibody to Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) in humans, domestic and wild ruminants. Validation data sets derived from field-collected sera in Africa (humans=1367, cattle=649, goats=806, sheep=493, buffalo=258, camels=156) were categorized according to the results of a virus neutralisation test. In addition, individual sera from 93 laboratory workers immunized with inactivated RVF vaccine, 136 serial bleeds from eight sheep experimentally infected with wild-type of RVFV, and 200 serial bleeds from 10 sheep vaccinated with the live-attenuated strain of the virus, were used to study the kinetics of RVFV antibody production under controlled conditions. At cut-off values selected at 95% accuracy level by the two-graph receiver operating characteristic analysis the ELISA sensitivity ranged from 99.47% (humans) to 100% (sheep, buffalo, camels). The specificity ranged from 99.29% (sheep) to 100% (camels). Compared to virus neutralisation and haemagglutination-inhibition tests, the ELISA was more sensitive in detection of the earliest immunological responses in experimentally infected and vaccinated sheep. Our results demonstrate that the ELISA format reported here can be used as a safe, robust and highly accurate diagnostic tool in disease-surveillance and control programmes, import/export veterinary certification, and for monitoring of the immune response in vaccinees."
"Journal of virology","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), which belongs to the genus Phlebovirus, family Bunyaviridae, has a tripartite negative-strand genome (S, M, and L segments) and is an important mosquito-borne pathogen for domestic animals and humans. We established an RVFV T7 RNA polymerase-driven minigenome system in which T7 RNA polymerase from an expression plasmid drove expression of RNA transcripts for viral proteins and minigenome RNA transcripts carrying a reporter gene between both termini of the M RNA segment in 293T cells. Like other viruses of the Bunyaviridae family, replication and transcription of the RVFV minigenome required expression of viral N and L proteins. Unexpectedly, the coexpression of an RVFV nonstructural protein, NSs, with N and L proteins resulted in a significant enhancement of minigenome RNA replication. Coexpression of NSs protein with N and L proteins also enhanced minigenome mRNA transcription in the cells expressing viral-sense minigenome RNA transcripts. NSs protein expression increased the RNA replication of minigenomes that originated from S and L RNA segments. Enhancement of minigenome RNA synthesis by NSs protein occurred in cells lacking alpha/beta interferon (IFN-alpha/beta) genes, indicating that the effect of NSs protein on minigenome RNA replication was unrelated to a putative NSs protein-induced inhibition of IFN-alpha/beta production. Our finding that RVFV NSs protein augmented minigenome RNA synthesis was in sharp contrast to reports that Bunyamwera virus (genus Bunyavirus) NSs protein inhibits viral minigenome RNA synthesis, suggesting that RVFV NSs protein and Bunyamwera virus NSs protein have distinctly different biological roles in viral RNA synthesis."
"Vaccine","The South African vaccine strain of lumpy skin disease virus (type SA-Neethling) is currently being developed as a vector for recombinant vaccines of economically important livestock diseases throughout Africa. In this study, the feasibility of using the viral thymidine kinase gene as the site of insertion was investigated and recombinant viruses were evaluated in animal trials. Two separate recombinants were generated and selected for homogeneity expressing either the structural glycoprotein gene of bovine ephemeral fever virus (BEFV) or the two structural glycoprotein genes of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV). Both recombinants incorporate the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) as a visual marker and the Escherichia coli guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (gpt) gene for dominant positive selection. The LSDV-RVFV recombinant construct (rLSDV-RVFV) protected mice against virulent RVFV challenge. In a small-scale BEFV-challenge cattle trial the rLSDV-BEFV construct failed to fully protect the cattle against virulent challenge, although both a humoral and cellular BEFV-specific immune response was elicited."
"Uirusu","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) causes massive mosquito-borne epidemics among humans and decimates ruminants in which the mortality rate is about 1% and 10-30%, respectively. Morbidity in RVFV-infected humans is high largely due to the effects of hemorrhagic fever and encephalitis. This virus is native to sub-Saharan Africa; yet if this virus is introduced into the environment, virus transmission appears to occur whenever sheep and cattle are present with abundant mosquito populations. RVFV is a negative-strand RNA virus which belongs to the family Bunyaviridae, genus Phlebovirus, and contains tripartite-segmented genomes (S, M, and L). S-segment is the ambisense genome, where N and NSs genes are coded in an antiviral-sense and viral sense S-segment, respectively. The inhibition of host mRNA synthesis, which is induced by the binding of NSs protein to RNA polymerase II transcription factor TFIIH, is the primary reason for the host-protein shut-off in RVFV-infected cells. Development of a RVFV reverse genetics system, which has not been accomplished yet, is important for the study of viral replication mechanisms, host virus interaction, viral pathogenicity as well as vaccine evaluation and development."
"Acta virologica","An epizootic of febrile illness among the Madras red breed of sheep had occurred in 1994 in Verrapuram, Chennai, India. The epizootic was suspected as Rift Valley fever (RVF)-like sickness based on clinical features. However, its etiological agent could neither be isolated nor implicated conclusively. During the post-epizootic period a male lamb died of similar clinical features and the spleen was immediately collected. Inoculation of spleen suspension in infant mouse brain yielded a virus that was serially passaged in infant mice and rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells. Electron microscopic observations revealed virus particles resembling flaviviruses. RT-PCR performed on extracted total RNA from infected cells and mouse brains with flavivirus-specific or RVF-specific primers gave negative results. However, an amplicon of 280 bp was obtained with pestivirus-specific primers from the 5'-UTR. Further, a nested PCR yielded a product of 157 bp. Nucleotide sequencing of the 157 bp product showed 100% homology to BVDV-1. Western blot analysis with a flavivirus envelope protein-specific MAb revealed three proteins of 33 K, 45 K and 55 K. Further studies suggested that the 33 K and 55 K proteins were glycosylated. This is the first report of isolation of BVDV-1 from a lamb in India."
"Developments in biologicals","During the recent devastating epidemics of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), bluetongue (BT), the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) and New Castle disease, more than 115 million animals were culled. The mass slaughter of animals raised serious ethical questions. These epidemics showed that the use of emergency vaccination is an essential element in disease control. During the last decade the FMD antigen banks have proved to be effective and this module should be extended. An international vaccine stock should be considered for classical swine fever and HPAI. Agreements with vaccine producers should be made easily available, with instant access to a vaccine reserve for rinderpest, peste des petits ruminants, BT, African horse sickness and Rift valley fever. These vaccines should meet international standards and should allow distinction between vaccinated and infected animals. Information should be gathered proactively on the use of vaccines for lumpy skin disease, sheep and goat pox and contagious bovine pleuropneumonia."

The quality was assured to meet the internationally required levels of potency and sterility. The titer of the product was 1024 as evaluated by virus neutralization (VN) and agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID) tests. In its final form, it is a sterile disc of a lyophilized material with a pale yellow colour, placed into an evacuated, tightly capped and capsulated vial.

"Revue scientifique et technique (International Office of Epizootics)","Rift Valley fever (RVF) is an arthropod-borne viral disease of ruminants, camels and humans. It is also a significant zoonosis which may be encountered as an uncomplicated influenza-like illness, but may also present as a haemorrhagic disease with liver involvement; there may also be ocular or neurological lesions. In animals, RVF may be inapparent in non-pregnant adults, but outbreaks are characterised by the onset of abortions and high neonatal mortality. Jaundice hepatitis and death are seen in older animals. Outbreaks of RVF are associated with persistent heavy rainfall with sustained flooding and the appearance of large numbers of mosquitoes, the main vector. Localised heavy rainfall is seldom sufficient to create conditions for an outbreak; the simultaneous emergence of large numbers of first generation transovarially infected mosquitoes is also required. After virus amplification in vertebrates, mosquitoes act as secondary vectors to sustain the epidemic."
"Revue scientifique et technique (International Office of Epizootics)","Over the past few decades, the geographical distribution of arthropod-borne zoonoses has dramatically expanded. The influence of human-induced or ecological changes on the risk of disease outbreaks is undeniable. However, few hypotheses have been proposed which address the re-emergence of these diseases, the spread of these viruses to previously uninfected areas and their establishment therein. Host and vector movements play an important role in the dissemination of pathogens, and the ability of these diseases to colonise previously uninfected areas may be explained by the diversity of hosts and vectors, the presence of favourable ecological conditions, and the successful adaptations of vectors or pathogens to new ecosystems. The objective of this paper is to describe the epidemiological processes of the vector-borne diseases Rift Valley fever, West Nile fever, Japanese encephalitis and Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever."
"Ophthalmology","To report ocular complications of Rift Valley fever (RVF) during its first reported outbreak in southwest Saudi Arabia in autumn 2000.Cross-sectional study of patients in a referral hospital.One hundred forty-three consecutive patients with confirmed RVF serologic test results and ocular lesions were enrolled in the study.Hospitalized patients (n = 30) and outpatients (n = 113) with clinical symptoms consistent with RVF, positive RVF serologic test results, and ocular abnormalities were studied. Ophthalmologic examinations, including fundus photography and fluorescein angiography, were performed. Patients were followed up at regular intervals to determine the prognosis and outcome of identified ocular abnormalities.Visual acuity at initial presentation and course of anterior and posterior segment complications.Among 143 patients (78% males; mean age, 53.2 years), 212 eyes were affected, comprising 47 eyes in 30 inpatients and 165 eyes in 113 outpatients. The mean interval between the onset of RVF and visual symptoms ranged from 4 to 15 days (mean, 8.8 days). Macular or paramacular retinitis was identified in all the affected eyes (n = 212) at the time of initial assessment. Lesions included retinal hemorrhages (40%), vitreous reactions (26%), optic disc edema (15%), and retinal vasculitis (7%). Anterior uveitis was present in 31% of outpatients. Fluorescein angiography of the retinitis showed early hypofluorescence with late staining of retinal lesions and blood vessels. Initial visual acuity was less than 20/200 in 80% of eyes in the outpatient group; their vision improved, deteriorated, or remained the same in 13%, 15%, or 72%, respectively. Evaluation at the last follow-up showed macular (60%) or paramacular (9%) scarring, vascular occlusion (23%), and optic atrophy (20%) in the outpatient group.Rift Valley fever was associated with major ocular morbidity. Ocular manifestations of RVF occurred with a relatively higher frequency than reported up to now and were not limited to severe infections. Rift Valley fever affects the uvea and posterior chorioretinal area and is associated with permanent visual loss resulting from macular and paramacular scarring, vascular occlusion, and optic atrophy. The study demonstrated for the first time that transient nongranulomatous anterior uveitis is associated with RVF."
"Journal of medical entomology","Correct classification of the insect vector is central to the study of arboviral disease. A simple molecular method for identification of the main vectors of the mosquito-borne viruses, dengue, yellow fever, and Rift Valley fever in Senegal, West Africa, was developed. We present a system in which the five mosquito species (Diptera: Culicidae) responsible for the majority of flaviviral disease transmission in Senegal can be reliably identified using small amounts of DNA coextracted during flaviviral screening procedures, via an easy amplification of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome oxidase c subunit I or II (COI or COII, respectively). We observed that despite very similar morphology, the two cryptic disease vector species Aedes furcifer Edwards and Aedes taylori Edwards are highly divergent at the molecular level. This sequence variation was used as a basis for the development of a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment-length polymorphism system for the differentiation of the two species. We also present the first investigation of the phylogeny of the culicine mosquitoes based on all COI and COII sequences currently available. There seems to be very low intraspecific variation in both genes, whereas interspecific variation is high. As a consequence, COI and COII are ideal candidates for the molecular identification of disease vectors to species level, whereas deeper divergences remain equivocal by using these genes. This system provides a new technique for the accurate identification of culicine disease vectors in West Africa and provides a basis for the expansion of such methods into the study of a range of diseases."
"Presse médicale (Paris, France : 1983)","Often responsible for little known infections, today viral encephalitis viruses appear as a new bioterrorist menace, because of their easy production and their great pathogenic potential. Spraying is the best way to permit the rapid diffusion of certain encephalitis viruses. Diagnosis of viral encephalitis, predominating in tropical surroundings, is difficult. In the majority of cases, symptoms differ little from those of common flu. With supplementary examinations, the biological abnormalities are usually non-specific. There are no characteristic images on scans or MRI. Identification of the virus in the nasopharynx, blood or cerebrospinal fluid, in serology, PCR or RT-PCR permits confirmation of the virus. Treatment is essentially symptomatic and relies on appropriate reanimation measures. Ribavirin can be indicated in some cases such as the Rift Valley fever, but is formally contraindicated in West Nile encephalitis. The aim of terrorist groups who would use this type of weapon is more to provoke panic and disorganisation than to kill as many people as possible."
"Euro surveillance : bulletin Européen sur les maladies transmissibles = European communicable disease bulletin","Haemorrhagic fever viruses (HFVs) are a diverse group of viruses that cause a clinical disease associated with fever and bleeding disorder.

In terms of biological warfare concerning dengue, Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever and Hantaviruses, there is not sufficient knowledge to include them as a major biological threat. Dengue virus is the only one of these that cannot be transmitted via aerosol. Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever and the agents of haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome appear difficult to weaponise. Ribavirin is recommended for the treatment and the prophylaxis of the arenaviruses and the bunyaviruses, but is not effective for the other families.

"Journal of virological methods","Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus is an important zoonotic and a potential biothreat agent. This paper describes validation of sandwich and capture enzyme-linked immunoassays (ELISA) based on gamma-irradiated antigens for the detection of RVFV-specific IgG and IgM antibody in humans. Validation data sets derived from testing field-collected sera from Africa (n=2400) were dichotomised according to the results of a virus neutralisation test. In addition, sera from laboratory workers immunized with inactivated RVF vaccine (n=93) and serial sera (n=3) from a single RVF case were used. ELISA data were expressed as percentage of high-positive control serum (PP). Cut-off values at 95% accuracy level were optimised using the misclassification cost term option of the two-graph receiver operating characteristics analysis. During the routine use of assays there was no evidence for excessive intra- and inter-plate variations within and between runs of assays. At a cut-off of 13.2 PP the sensitivity of the IgG-sandwich ELISA was 100% and specificity 99.95%, while for the IgM-capture ELISA the values were 96.47 and 99.44%, respectively, at a cut-off of 7.1 PP. Compared to the virus neutralisation test, the IgG-sandwich ELISA was more sensitive in detection of immunological responses in vaccines. Following natural infection class-specific antibodies were detected in serum taken 6 days after onset of symptoms. The results demonstrate that both assays will be useful for early diagnosis of infection, epidemiological surveillance and for monitoring of immune response after vaccination. As highly accurate, robust and safe tests, they have the potential to replace traditional diagnostic methods which are unable to distinguish between different classes of immunoglobulins, and pose health risks necessitating their use being restricted to high containment facilities outside RVF endemic areas."
"Journal of virological methods","We developed four assays for specifically identifying Dobrava (DOB), Hantaan (HTN), Puumala (PUU), and Seoul (SEO) viruses. The assays are based on the real-time one-step reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with the small segment used as the target sequence. The detection limits of DOB, HTN, PUU, and SEO assays were 25, 25, 25, and 12.5 plaque-forming units, respectively. The assays were evaluated in blinded experiments, each with 100 samples that contained Andes, Black Creek Canal, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, Rift Valley fever and Sin Nombre viruses in addition to DOB, HTN, PUU and SEO viruses. The sensitivity levels of the DOB, HTN, PUU, and SEO assays were 98%, 96%, 92% and 94%, respectively. The specificity of DOB, HTN and SEO assays was 100% and the specificity of the PUU assay was 98%. Because of the high levels of sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility, we believe that these assays can be useful for diagnosing and differentiating these four Old-World hantaviruses."

Significant progress has been made in understanding the biology of the Ebola virus, one of the best known examples. This knowledge has guided our thinking about other VHF agents, including Marburg, Lassa, the South American arenaviruses, yellow fever, Crimean-Congo and Rift Valley fever viruses. Comparisons among VHFs show that a common pathogenic feature is their ability to disable the host immune response by attacking and manipulating the cells that initiate the antiviral response. Of equal importance, these comparisons highlight critical gaps in our knowledge of these pathogens."

The viral RNA was detected in all pools containing infected mosquitoes and was shown to be as sensitive as infant mice but more sensitive than Vero cell cultures for virus detection. Pools diluted down to the equivalent of 1:16 000 mosquitoes were also positive by RT-PCR. RNAs from 4 other phleboviruses were negative, there were no false positives and the procedure followed, with the 2 particular primers chosen, gave consistently clear bands of the PCR products on agarose gels without nested PCR being necessary."
"Journal of medical entomology","We examined the potential for Phlebotomus papatasi (Scopoli), Phlebotomus duboscqi (Neveu-Lemarie), Phlebotomus sergenti (Parrot), and Sergentomyia schwetzi (Adler, Theodor, & Parrot) to transmit Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus. After feeding on hamsters that had been inoculated with RVF virus, P. papatasi, P. sergenti, and S. schwetzi became infected and developed disseminated infections. All P. papatasi and P. duboscqi inoculated with RVF virus developed high-titer infections. In contrast, only 41% of the inoculated S. schwetzi contained detectable virus, and infected individuals contained significantly less virus than the two Phlebotomus species. Although 50% of the inoculated P. duboscqi transmitted RVF virus to hamsters, only 14% of P. papatasi and none of the S. schwetzi transmitted this virus. Additional studies are needed to determine the role of sand flies as vectors of RVF virus."
"Medical and veterinary entomology","Rift Valley Fever (RVF) is a growing health problem in West Africa. In northern Senegal, the candidate vectors of this arbovirosis are Aedes (Aedimorphus) vexans Meigen and Culex (Culex) poicilipes Theobald (Diptera: Culicidae). Domestic ruminants are the reservoirs of the virus. A study was undertaken during the 2002 rainy season to assess spatial and temporal variations in exposure to mosquito bites in sheep herds, and to evaluate the possible consequences on the risk of RVF transmission to sheep. Mosquitoes were collected with sheep-baited traps. The number of Ae. vexans females (the predominant species during the 2002 rainy season) trapped per trap-night was the dependent variable in statistical analyses. The trapping periods were divided into six series of two to five consecutive days, from July to November 2002. Three temporary ponds were selected according to their ecological features: depth, bank slope, size and vegetation cover. Traps were laid on the pond bank and in the nearest available compound, close to the sheep night pen. Data were analysed using mixed-effects Poisson models. The explanatory variables were the trapping period, the pond, and the capture site. The exposure to mosquito bites varied according to the pond type, suggesting that the risk of transmission was spatially heterogeneous. However, there was no obvious trend in transmission risk due to the effect of the distance from the compound to the pond. The period with the highest exposure was in October, i.e. when transhumant herds left the Ferlo to relocate to their dry-season settlement. It is thus hypothesized that transhumance, the seasonal movements of herds, plays a significant role in the dissemination of RVF virus in the region."
"Journal of virology","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is an important cause of epizootics and epidemics in Africa and a potential agent of bioterrorism. A better understanding of the factors that govern RVFV virulence and pathogenicity is required, given the urgent need for antiviral therapies and safe vaccines. We have previously shown that RVFV strains with mutations in the NSs gene are excellent inducers of alpha/beta interferon (IFN-alpha/beta) and are highly attenuated in mice. Here, we demonstrate that NSs is sufficient to block IFN-beta gene expression at the transcriptional level. In cells transiently expressing NSs, IFN-beta transcripts were not inducible by viral infection or by transfection of poly(I:C). NSs with anti-IFN activity accumulated in the nucleus. In contrast, mutant forms of NSs that had lost their IFN-inhibiting activity remained in the cytoplasm, indicating that nuclear localization plays a role. IFN synthesis is regulated by specific transcription factors, including interferon regulatory factor (IRF-3), NF-kappaB, and AP-1. In the presence of NSs, IRF-3 was still activated and moved to the nucleus. Likewise, NF-kappaB and AP-1 were activated normally, as shown in electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Moreover, NSs was found to inhibit transcriptional activity of a constitutive promoter, in agreement with recent findings showing that NSs targets the basal cellular transcription factor TFIIH. The present results suggest that NSs, unlike other viral IFN antagonists, does not inhibit IFN-specific transcription factors but blocks IFN gene expression at a subsequent step.Copyright 2004 American Society for Microbiology"
"Clinics in laboratory medicine","It is well recognized that most emerging diseases of humans are zoonotic, and that the forces working to create emerging diseases in humans are also operating in animal populations. However, what is often overlooked is that emerging human diseases are usually preceded by the emergence of the same pathogen in an animal population. In fact, the developing disease in animals acts as a link allowing the disease to take hold and wreck havoc in public health. Numerous examples--Rift Valley fever, monkeypox, Nipah, and Ebola--serve to underscore this linkage and to highlight the increasing interconnectedness of animal and human health."

"Vector borne and zoonotic diseases (Larchmont, N.Y.)","High activity of the Rift Valley Fever (RVF) virus is related to a tremendous increase of associated mosquito vectors, which follows periods of high rainfall. Indeed, rainfall creates an ecologically humid environment that insures the proliferation of breeding sites and the development of RVF vectors. Data collected by Fontenille et al. (1998) from 1991 to 1996 in the Barkedji area in the northern Senegal are employed to discuss and quantify the incidence of rainfall upon the abundances of RVF vectors. We have constructed a non-linear mapping of vector abundances versus rainfall variations, and developed a stochastic model and a corresponding algorithm allowing on output the simulation of RVF mosquito vectors as a function of rainfall trajectories in the course of time. This stochastic mapping of vector abundance is subsequently used to assess the prevalence of RVF in a population of susceptible hosts as a consequence of rainfall."
"Revue scientifique et technique (International Office of Epizootics)","A retrospective study was undertaken to examine domestic ruminant sera for Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus antibodies. The sera were collected between 1992 and 1995 from cattle, sheep and goats from various locations in Saudi Arabia. The standard capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system was employed to detect specific RVF antibodies in the animals and the results indicated an absence of RVF antibodies. This finding confirms the assumption that Saudi Arabia was free from RVF up until at least 1995 and most probably before the 2000 epidemic. The finding also confirms that RVF was not endemic in Saudi Arabia."
"Molecular cell","In the February 20 issue of Cell, report that Rift Valley Fever Virus (RVFV) targets cellular transcriptional apparatus to inhibit RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription.

"Cell","The Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is the causative agent of fatal hemorrhagic fever in humans and acute hepatitis in ruminants. We found that infection by RVFV leads to a rapid and drastic suppression of host cellular RNA synthesis that parallels a decrease of the TFIIH transcription factor cellular concentration. Using yeast two hybrid system, recombinant technology, and confocal microscopy, we further demonstrated that the nonstructural viral NSs protein interacts with the p44 component of TFIIH to form nuclear filamentous structures that also contain XPB subunit of TFIIH. By competing with XPD, the natural partner of p44 within TFIIH, and sequestering p44 and XPB subunits, NSs prevents the assembly of TFIIH subunits, thus destabilizing the normal host cell life. These observations shed light on the mechanism utilized by RVFV to evade the host response."

"Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology","Viruses are important pathogens in tropical areas; most of them, especially the tropical hemorrhagic fevers, produce mucocutaneous manifestations. More than any other kind of pathogen, viruses have the possibility for being widespread, since they have a greater probability of mutation than do bacteria, can cross species barriers easily, and infect both human beings and animals in habitats with a great biodiversity. Tropical habitats also have been subject to major ecologic changes in the last few decades, exposing humans to direct contact with these viruses and allowing hemorrhagic fevers due to new emergent viruses such as flaviviruses, filoviruses, arenaviruses, and hantaviruses to become major threats to public health. The collapse of eradication programs in many countries, as well as population increases and ecologic modifications, have led to the spread of dengue and yellow fever to large portions of the world owing to the dissemination of vectors, especially mosquitoes, with broad ecologic ranges. Viruses previously restricted to some geographic areas, such as Rift Valley fever, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, West Nile fever, and monkeypox are now affecting new countries and populations. Other viruses such as herpes B infection often affect travelers and animal handlers in most parts of the world. Dermatologic lesions occur in all these diseases and can facilitate a rapid diagnosis, leading to control of the virus and helping prevent possible outbreaks."
"The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene","Adult golden hamsters inoculated subcutaneously with either of two sandfly fever group viruses, Punta Toro and Gabek Forest (Phlebovirus, Bunyaviridae), developed a fulminating fatal illness characterized by hepatic and splenic necrosis and interstitial pneumonitis. Most animals died within three days after infection; this was accompanied by high levels of viremia. Necropsy and histopathologic examination of the infected animals revealed pathologic changes involving multiple organs that resembled those described in Rift Valley fever. These two hamster-phlebovirus systems may serve as alternative animal models for Rift Valley fever and should be useful in studying the pathogenesis of severe phlebovirus infection and for testing potential therapeutic agents."
"Journal of virological methods","The recent occurrence of the first confirmed outbreaks of Rift Valley fever in humans and livestock outside the African region, namely in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Yemen, is of global medical and veterinary concern. Disadvantages of classical techniques for serological diagnosis of Rift Valley fever include health risk to laboratory personnel, restrictions for their use outside endemic areas and inability to distinguish between different classes of immunoglobulins. We report on the development and validation of sandwich and capture ELISAs (both based on inactivated antigen) for detection of IgG and IgM antibody to Rift Valley fever virus in bovine, caprine and ovine sera. Compared to virus neutralisation and haemagglutination-inhibition tests, the IgG sandwich ELISA was more sensitive in detection of the earliest immunological responses to infection or vaccination with Rift Valley fever virus. Its sensitivity and specificity derived from field data sets ranged in different ruminant species from 99.05 to 100% and from 99.1 to 99.9%, respectively. The specificity of IgM-capture ELISA varied between different species from 97.4 to 99.4%; its sensitivity was 100% in sheep tested 5-42 days post-infection. Our results in field-collected, experimental and post-vaccination sera demonstrate that these assays will be useful for epidemiological surveillance and control programmes, import/export veterinary certification, early diagnosis of infection, and for monitoring of immune response in vaccinated animals. As highly accurate and safe tests, they have the potential to replace traditional diagnostic methods, which pose biohazard risks limiting their use outside of endemic areas to high containment facilities."
"Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America","This cohort descriptive study summarizes the epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory characteristics of the Rift Valley fever (RVF) epidemic that occurred in Saudi Arabia from 26 August 2000 through 22 September 2001. A total of 886 cases were reported. Of 834 reported cases for which laboratory results were available, 81.9% were laboratory confirmed, of which 51.1% were positive for only RVF immunoglobulin M, 35.7% were positive for only RVF antigen, and 13.2% were positive for both. The mean age (+/- standard deviation) was 46.9+/-19.4 years, and the ratio of male to female patients was 4:1. Clinical and laboratory features included fever (92.6% of patients), nausea (59.4%), vomiting (52.6%), abdominal pain (38.0%), diarrhea (22.1%), jaundice (18.1%), neurological manifestations (17.1%), hemorrhagic manifestations (7.1%), vision loss or scotomas (1.5%), elevated liver enzyme levels (98%), elevated lactate dehydrogenase level (60.2%), thrombocytopenia (38.4%), leukopenia (39.7%), renal impairment or failure (27.8%), elevated creatine kinase level (27.3%), and severe anemia (15.1%). The mortality rate was 13.9%. Bleeding, neurological manifestations, and jaundice were independently associated with a high mortality rate. Patients with leukopenia had significantly a lower mortality rate than did those with a normal or high leukocyte count (2.3% vs. 27.9%; odds ratio, 0.09; 95% confidence interval, 0.01-0.63)."
"The Journal of general virology","Recombination is increasingly seen as an important means of shaping genetic diversity in RNA viruses. However, observed recombination frequencies vary widely among those viruses studied to date, with only sporadic occurrences reported in RNA viruses with negative-sense genomes. To determine the extent of homologous recombination in negative-sense RNA viruses, phylogenetic analyses of 79 gene sequence alignments from 35 negative-sense RNA viruses (a total of 2154 sequences) were carried out. Powerful evidence was found for recombination, in the form of incongruent phylogenetic trees between different gene regions, in only five sequences from Hantaan virus, Mumps virus and Newcastle disease virus. This is the first report of recombination in these viruses. More tentative evidence for recombination, where conflicting phylogenetic trees were observed (but were without strong bootstrap support) and/or where putative recombinant regions were very short, was found in three alignments from La Crosse virus and Puumala virus. Finally, patterns of sequence variation compatible with the action of recombination, but not definitive evidence for this process, were observed in a further ten viruses: Canine distemper virus, Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus, Influenza A virus, Influenza B virus, Influenza C virus, Lassa virus, Pirital virus, Rabies virus, Rift Valley Fever virus and Vesicular stomatitis virus. The possibility of recombination in these viruses should be investigated further. Overall, this study reveals that rates of homologous recombination in negative-sense RNA viruses are very much lower than those of mutation, with many viruses seemingly clonal on current data. Consequently, recombination rate is unlikely to be a trait that is set by natural selection to create advantageous or purge deleterious mutations."
"Journal of veterinary medical education","While there is no evidence to suggest that the recent epidemic of foot-and-mouth disease (Fmd) in the Uk and its subsequent spread to continental Europe were caused by bioterrorism, the extent of the epidemic shows that Fmd could be a very powerful weapon for a bioterrorist wishing to cause widespread disease in livestock and economic disruption for the targeted country. This paper describes the epidemic. It then examines the contentious issues that arose through the use of extensive slaughter to control the epidemic and explores how, in turn, the concerns of society are being translated into a radical change in policy within the European Union with respect to the control of Fmd and other foreign animal diseases. The crisis generated by the Fmd epidemic in Europe in 2001 provides many lessons to be learned for the US and highlights the need for creative thinking in research and teaching within colleges of veterinary medicine to more effectively address the threat of epidemic diseases under the ""new world order."" There is general agreement that the veterinary profession in the US plays a unique role in protecting the nation against epidemic livestock diseases, whether caused naturally or through bioterrorism. The profession also has a significant role in protecting the public's health, since several epidemic diseases of animals, such as rift valley fever, are zoonotic. However, improved financial support at the federal and state levels is urgently needed to support epidemic-diseases research and teaching in colleges of veterinary medicine."
"Médecine tropicale : revue du Corps de santé colonial","The epidemiological hallmark of the new millennium has been the emergence or recrudescence of transmissible diseases with high epidemic potential. Disease tracking is becoming an increasingly global task requiring implementation of more and more sophisticated control strategies and facilities for sustainable development. A promising initiative involves the use of satellite technology to monitor and forecast the spread of disease. The Health Early Warning System (HEWS) was designed based on successful application of satellite data in food programs as well as in other areas (e.g. weather, farming and fishing). The HEWS integrates data from communications, remote-sensing and positioning satellites. The purpose of this review is to present the main studies containing satellite data on public health in tropical areas. Satellite data has allowed development of more reactive epidemiological tracking networks better suited to increasing population mobility, correlation of environmental factors (vegetation index, rainfall and ocean surface color) with human, animal and insect factors in epidemiological studies and assessment of the role of such factors in the development or reappearance of disease. Satellite technology holds great promise for more efficient management of public health problems in tropical areas."
"Journal of medical virology","Phleboviruses are a large and widespread group of viruses that are transmitted by arthropods. Toscana virus is one of the principal agents that causes meningitis in humans during the summer in Italy and, possibly, in other Mediterranean countries. Rift Valley Fever virus can cause serious illness in both animals and humans, leading to high morbidity and mortality, and is considered to be a potential agent for epizootics and human epidemics. Since information on this group of viruses is still scant, reliable laboratory tools for diagnosis and epidemiological surveillance must be developed, in order to ascertain their real impact on Public Health. Sequence data obtained from Spanish isolates of Toscana virus and other phleboviruses confirmed that natural genome variability may hamper the diagnosis of these agents by molecular methods, so this must be borne in mind when developing reliable assays. In view of the above, a novel and useful protocol has been developed for the detection and specific identification of every member of the phlebovirus genus present in a sample, including Toscana virus, based on a generic RT-nested-PCR, followed by sequencing of the amplified fragment. A change in this method also allowed specific direct detection and identification of wild isolates of Toscana virus of different geographical origin, using newly designed primers. Testing clinical samples with these assays confirmed the role of Toscana virus as an agent that causes acute aseptic meningitis in the central region of Spain.Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc."
"The Onderstepoort journal of veterinary research","An indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (I-ELISA) for the detection of specific IgG immunoglobulins against Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) was validated in-house. A total of 3055 sera from sheep (n = 1159), goats (n = 636), cattle (n = 203), African buffalo (n = 928), and other wild ruminants (n = 129), including eland, kudu, and black wildebeest, was used. Sera from domestic ruminants were collected in West (n = 10), South (n = 1654) and East Africa (n = 334), and sera from wild ruminants (n = 1064) were collected in South Africa. In addition, 136 sera from eight experimentally RVFV-infected sheep, taken during a period of 28 days post infection (dpi), were used to study the kinetics of RVFV antibody production. Field sera were tested by the serum neutralization (VN) test and experimental sera by VN and haemagglutination-inhibition (HI) test. Based on VN test results, negative sera were regarded as reference controls from RVFV-free, and positive sera were regarded as reference controls from RVFV-infected subpopulations of animals. ELISA data were expressed as the percentage positivity (PP) of an internal high positive control. The two-graph receiver operating characteristics approach was used for the selection and optimization of I-ELISA cut-offs including the misclassification costs term and Youden index (J). In addition, cut-off values were determined as the mean plus two-fold standard deviation of the result observed with the RVFV-free subpopulations. Established optimal cut-offs were different for each of the data sets analyzed, and ranged from 1.65 PP (buffalo) to 9.1 PP (goats). At the cut-off giving the highest estimate of combined measure of diagnostic accuracy (highest J value), the I-ELISA test parameters were determined as follows: (1) Diagnostic sensitivity (%): cattle--84.31, buffalo--94.44, sheep--98.91, goats--99.18. (2) Diagnostic specificity (%): cattle--99.34, buffalo--98.28, sheep--99.16, goats--99.23 and other game ruminants--99.26. In the group of RVFV-experimentally infected sheep, seroconversion In all individuals was detected by VN on 4-6 dpi, by HI on 5-7 dpi, and by I-ELISA on 6-7 dpi. All tests showed the same kinetic pattern of immunological response. Antibody levels were low for a very short period before increasing to high titres, after which it was easily detectable by all tests. Compared to traditional tests, the lower sensitivity of I-ELISA in the detection of the earliest stage of immunological response may be practically insignificant, particularily when this assay is used in population-based, disease-surveillance programmes. The high sensitivity and specificity of I-ELISA established in this study, especially for the statistically more representative subpopulations of animals tested, seem to support this prediction. Test parameters determined in this study should, however, be regarded as in-house diagnostic decision limits, for which further updating is recommended, particularly for specimens from other countries, and preferably by applying a standardized method for sampling of new subpopulations of animals to be targeted by the assay."
"Vaccine","Rhesus macaques, intravenously inoculated with virulent Rift Valley fever virus, develop viremia and biochemical evidence of liver damage and serve as a model for human disease. Some of these monkeys suffer more serious disease with hemorrhagic phenomena and approximately 20% die with frank hemorrhage. Presently, the only Rift Valley fever vaccine approved for use in humans is a formalin-killed product that requires annual booster vaccinations. Efforts to produce an improved vaccine to replace the present vaccine have led to a mutagen-attenuated strain of Rift Valley fever virus that was found to be markedly attenuated for rhesus macaques and showed promise as a vaccine candidate for human use. Neurovirulence testing in rhesus monkeys showed that, while the vaccine was not completely innocuous, residual lesions were no more severe than the currently used 17D yellow fever vaccine."

"Emerging infectious diseases","To assess community needs for public information during a bioterrorism-related crisis, we simulated an intentional Rift Valley fever outbreak in a community in the southern part of the United States. We videotaped a series of simulated print and television ""news reports"" over a fictional 9-day crisis period and invited various groups (e.g., first-responders and their spouses or partners, journalists) within the selected community to view the videotape and respond to questions about their reactions. All responses were given anonymously. First-responders and their spouses or partners varied in their reactions about how the crisis affected family harmony and job performance. Local journalists exhibited considerable personal fear and confusion. All groups demanded, and put more trust in, information from local sources. These findings may have implications for risk communication during bioterrorism-related outbreaks."
"Journal of the American Mosquito Control Association","Entomological surveillance was conducted in Asir, Jizan, and Makkah regions, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, during December 2000 in response to an outbreak of Rift Valley fever. Aedes (Stegomyia) unilineatus was collected in CO2-baited Centers for Disease Control miniature light traps at 4 widely spaced sites. This represents the 1st record of this species from the Arabian Peninsula. Previously, the distribution of Ae. unilineatus included Africa, Pakistan, and India. No arboviruses were isolated from 18 females tested by Vero cell plaque assay."
"International journal of antimicrobial agents","Rift Valley fever (RVF) is an acute viral disease, affecting mainly livestock but also humans. The virus is transmitted to humans through mosquito bites or by exposure to blood and bodily fluids. Drinking raw, unpasteurized milk from infected animals can also transmit RVF. Routine vaccination of livestock in Africa has been prohibitively expensive, leading to endemicity of RVF in most African countries. Reports in September 2000 first documented RVF occurring outside of Africa in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Yemen. Prior to this outbreak, the potential for RVF spread into the Arabian Peninsula had already been exemplified by a 1977 Egyptian epidemic. This appearance of RVF outside the African Continent might be related to importation of infected animals from Africa. In the most recent outbreak patients presented with a febrile haemorrhagic syndrome accompanied by liver and renal dysfunction. By the end of the outbreak, April 2001 statistics from the Saudi Ministry of Health documented a total of 882 confirmed cases with 124 deaths. Both the severity of disease and the relatively high 14% death rate might be a consequence of underreporting of less severe disease. Travellers to endemic areas may be at risk of acquiring the disease if exposed to animals or their body fluids directly or through mosquito bites. Special education regarding both modes of transmission and the geographical distribution of this disease needs to be given to travellers at risk."
"Antiviral research","When considering viruses of potential importance as tools for bioterrorism, several viruses in the Bunya- and Togaviridae families have been cited. Among those in the Bunyaviridae family are Rift Valley fever, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, hanta, and sandfly fever viruses, listed in order of priority. Those particularly considered in the Togaviridae family are Venezuelan, eastern and western equine encephalitis viruses. Factors affecting the selection of these viruses are the ability for them to induce a fatal or seriously incapacitating illness, their ease of cultivation in order to prepare large volumes, their relative infectivity in human patients, their ability to be transmitted by aerosol, and the lack of measures available for their control. Each factor is fully considered in this review. Vaccines for the control of infections induced by these viruses are in varying stages of development, with none universally accepted to date. Viruses in the Bunyaviridae family are generally sensitive to ribavirin, which has been recommended as an emergency therapy for infections by viruses in this family although has not yet been FDA-approved. Interferon and interferon inducers also significantly inhibit these virus infections in animal models. Against infections induced by viruses in the Togaviridae family, interferon-alpha would appear to currently be the most useful for therapy."
"Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America","We describe the clinical patterns and case-fatality rate associated with severe Rift Valley fever (RVF) in patients who were admitted to the Gizan regional referral hospital during an outbreak of RVF in Saudi Arabia from September through November 2000. A total of 165 consecutive patients (136 men and 29 women) were prospectively studied; all were identified according to a strict case definition, were confirmed to have RVF by serologic testing, and were treated according to a predetermined protocol. The major clinical characteristics of RVF included a high frequency of hepatocellular failure in 124 patients (75.2%), acute renal failure in 68 patients (41.2%), and hemorrhagic manifestations in 32 patients (19.4%). Sixteen patients had retinitis and 7 patients had meningoencephalitis as late complications in the course of the disease. A total of 56 patients (33.9%) died. Hepatorenal failure, shock, and severe anemia were major factors associated with patient death."
"Emerging infectious diseases","An outbreak of Rift Valley fever in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Yemen in 2000 was the first recognized occurrence of the illness outside of Africa and Madagascar. An assessment of potential mosquito vectors in the region yielded an isolate from Aedes vexans arabiensis, most closely related to strains from Madagascar (1991) and Kenya (1997)."
"Emerging infectious diseases","The first confirmed Rift Valley fever outbreak outside Africa was reported in September 2000, in the Arabian Peninsula. As of February 2001, a total of 884 hospitalized patients were identified in Saudi Arabia, with 124 deaths. In Yemen, 1,087 cases were estimated to have occurred, with 121 deaths. Laboratory diagnosis of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) infections included virus genetic detection and characterization of clinical specimens by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, in addition to serologic tests and virus isolation. Genetic analysis of selected regions of virus S, M, and L RNA genome segments indicated little genetic variation among the viruses associated with disease. The Saudi Arabia and Yemen viruses were almost identical to those associated with earlier RVF epidemics in East Africa. Analysis of S, M, and L RNA genome segment sequence differences showed similar phylogenetic relationships among these viruses, indicating that genetic reassortment did not play an important role in the emergence of this virus in the Arabian Peninsula. These results are consistent with the recent introduction of RVFV into the Arabian Peninsula from East Africa."
"The Veterinary clinics of North America. Food animal practice","Rift Valley fever virus is an arthropod-borne Phlebovirus endemic in sub-Saharan Africa. Outbreaks also have occurred in Egypt, Madagascar, and most recently in the Arabian peninsula. Large epizootics occur at irregular intervals in seasons of above-average rainfall with persistent flooding and the appearance of large numbers of floodwater-breeding Aedine mosquitoes. The virus is transmitted transovarially and can remain dormant in mosquito eggs during dry interepizootic periods. Low-level virus circulation occurs in high-rainfall forested areas, although individual cases of the disease rarely are recognized. RVF is characterized by abortion in pregnant animals and a high mortality in newborn lambs, kids, and calves. Susceptibility to disease is related to age and breed, with severe disease occurring in the young of exotic sheep and cattle breeds. RVF is a zoonosis, and human beings experience an influenza-like illness and, more rarely, complications such as encephalitis or retinitis. The virus causes a severe hepatitis, particularly in aborted fetuses and newborn lambs. The disease must be differentiated from other conditions that cause death with hepatitis and jaundice. Both an inactivated and a live attenuated vaccine are available. New-generation vaccines are being tested, because the existing mousebrain-attenuated strain induces fetal teratology or abortion in a percentage of pregnant animals. Diagnosis is based on histopathology or the demonstration of viral antigen or antibody."
"Journal of virology","As Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus, and probably all members of the family Bunyaviridae, matures in the Golgi apparatus, the targeting of the virus glycoproteins to the Golgi apparatus plays a pivotal role in the virus replication cycle. No consensus Golgi localization motif appears to be shared among the glycoproteins of these viruses. The viruses of the family Bunyaviridae synthesize their glycoproteins, G(N) and G(C), as a polyprotein. The Golgi localization signal of RVF virus has been shown to reside within the G(N) protein by use of a plasmid-based transient expression system to synthesize individual G(N) and G(C) proteins. While the distribution of individually expressed G(N) significantly overlaps with cellular Golgi proteins such as beta-COP and GS-28, G(C) expressed in the absence of G(N) localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum. Further analysis of expressed G(N) truncated proteins and green fluorescent protein/G(N) chimeric proteins demonstrated that the RVF virus Golgi localization signal mapped to a 48-amino-acid region of G(N) encompassing the 20-amino-acid transmembrane domain and the adjacent 28 amino acids of the cytosolic tail."
"Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences","Vector-borne viruses are no respecters of international boundaries. The recent outbreak of Rift Valley fever (RVF) in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) and Yemen in September 2000 clearly sends a message that once pathogens cross their known geographic limits, they tend to adapt to the local ecology in order to survive and maintain transmission. This paper examines the various factors that may contribute to the establishment of RVF in the Arabian Peninsula (AP) and its possible spread to other countries. The annual influx of over 2 million pilgrims for the Hajj (annual pilgrimage for Muslims) in the KSA, as well as the large migrant population in this region, generates high human and animal traffic that presents a challenging agenda for public health. The potential risks within this period as well as other peculiar ecological factors are discussed."
"Virology","Rift Valley Fever (RVF) virus is an arbovirus and is responsible for large outbreaks of disease predominantly in sub-Saharan Africa. However, several aspects of RVF virus transmission, such as high viremia, multiple vector species, and broad host range, result in a pathogen with high likelihood of geographic spread. RVF virus infection in humans and livestock is characterized by broad dissemination of RVF virus antigens throughout the body. We sought insight into the high pathogenicity and broad tropism of this virus through a characterization of its interaction with polarized epithelial cells. Our results indicate that infection and release of RVF virus in polarized epithelial cells occurs at both apical and basolateral membranes and hence is bidirectional. Furthermore, our results indicate that RVF virus causes disruptions in both the microfilament and the microtubule networks. These disruptions may provide a mechanism for bidirectional release of RVF virions."
"The Onderstepoort journal of veterinary research","Diagnosis of Rift Valley fever (RVF) is based on serology and virus isolation. The disadvantages of the former include poor sensitivity, high cost, risks associated with using infectious virus as antigen, the lengthy duration of ELISA as well as cross-reactivity with other Phleboviruses. We developed, optimised and evaluated a one-tube reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the detection of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) in ruminants. The PCR primers for this assay were designed to anneal to a region within the M segment of the virus genome, encoding glycoproteins G1 and G2. A PCR amplicon of 363 bp was obtained. The sensitivity of the assay was determined to be 0.25 TCID50. This test should allow for the early and rapid detection of RVFV in both serum and whole blood. In addition, it could facilitate the quantification of antigen for the manufacture of current vaccines."

"Medical and veterinary entomology","In mid-September 2000, Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus was diagnosed as the cause of infection in humans and livestock in Jizan Region, Saudi Arabia. This is the first time that this arbovirus has been found outside Africa and Madagascar. Collections of mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) were therefore undertaken (from 25 September to 10 October) at eight sites during the epidemic to obtain mosquitoes for attempted RVF virus isolation. Among 23 699 mosquito females tested, six isolations of RVF virus were made from 15 428 Culex (Culex) tritaeniorhynchus Giles and seven from 8091 Aedes (Aedimorphus) vexans arabiensis Patton [corrected]. Minimum mosquito infection rates per 1000 at sites with infected mosquitoes were 0.3-13.8 Cx. tritaeniorhynchus and 1.94-9.03 Ae. v. arabiensis. Viral activity moved northwards as collecting was in progress and collectors 'caught up' with the virus at the two most northerly sites on the last two trapping evenings. Other species occurred in small numbers and were identified but not tested. Both Cx. tritaeniorhynchus and Ae. v. arabiensis were susceptible to RVF virus and transmitted between hamsters, and an additional quantitative test with Cx. tritaeniorhynchus showed that 71-73% of mosquitoes became infected after ingesting 6.9-7.9 log10 FFU/mL of virus; transmission rates were 10% (post-infection day 14) and 26% (post-infection day 20). It was concluded that both species were vectors on grounds of abundance, distribution, preference for humans and sheep, the virus isolations and vector competence tests."
"Archives of medical research","During the past 20 years there has been a dramatic resurgence or emergence of epidemic arboviral diseases affecting both humans and domestic animals. These epidemics have been caused primarily by viruses thought to be under control such as dengue, Japanese encephalitis, yellow fever, and Venezuelan equine encephalitis, or viruses that have expanded their geographic distribution such as West Nile and Rift Valley fever. Several of these viruses are presented as case studies to illustrate the changing epidemiology. The factors responsible for the dramatic resurgence of arboviral diseases in the waning years of the 20th century are discussed, as is the need for rebuilding the public health infrastructure to deal with epidemic vector-borne diseases in the 21st century."

"The Veterinary record","In two epidemics of bovine ephemeral fever (BEF) in Israel, one in 1990 and one in 1999, the virus was probably carried by vectors transported by air currents across the Rift Valley and through the Red Sea trough. The disease broke out under optimal ecological conditions among vulnerable cattle populations and spread rapidly; it developed in the spring and summer and ended soon after the daily average ambient temperature fell below 16 degrees C in late autumn. The proportion of herds affected reached 78.4 and 97.7 per cent in 1990 and 1999, respectively. The highest rates of incidence, morbidity and mortality were recorded in dairy cattle herds in the Jordan Valley, the initial focus of the outbreaks, with a morbidity of 20 and 38.6 per cent in 1990 and 1999, respectively, and mortality among the affected animals of 2 and 8.6 per cent in 1990 and 1999, respectively. In 1991, the disease recurred sporadically in the central and southern regions of Israel in only three herds, but in 2000 the disease returned on an epidemic scale, and 85 per cent of herds were affected, with morbidity and mortality rates of 4-3 and 0-3 per cent, respectively. In the 1999 epidemic, the morbidity rate decreased from 38-6 per cent on average in the Jordan Valley to 12.8 per cent in the inner valleys and 5.3 per cent on the Mediterranean coastal plain, but the mortality rate increased from 8-6 per cent in the Jordan Valley to 14-3 per cent in the inner valleys, and to 28 per cent on the Mediterranean coastal plain, where the outbreak declined. An average of 2-7 per cent of the animals experienced a second attack of the disease two to six weeks later. The epidemic in 2000 was milder and shorter than that in 1999. All the cattle affected in both outbreaks were more than three months old. The vector(s) is not known for certain but the available evidence indicates that mosquitoes, and not Culicoides species, are the natural vectors of BEF virus in Israel."
"The Onderstepoort journal of veterinary research","A 5-fluorouracil mutagenised Rift Valley fever virus strain, which was shown to be attenuated and immunogenic in cattle and sheep, was evaluated for its ability to cause teratogenic effects in pregnant sheep. A group of 50 sheep at various stages of pregnancy was inoculated with the virus and the pregnancies followed to term. There were two abortions and 14% of the lambs produced by vaccinated ewes showed teratogenic effects, the most prevalent being spinal hypoplasia, hydranencephaly, brachygnathia inferior and arthrygryposis. The foetal malformations of the central nervous and musculo-skeletal systems were mostly consistent with those observed in sheep vaccinated with the attenuated Smithburn RVF strain. The teratogenic effects of MVP12 were not seen in previous experiments by other authors as immunisation of sheep took place in the second to third trimester of pregnancy, when the foetal brain tissue has completed most of its cell division."
"Journal of clinical microbiology","Viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs) are acute infections with high case fatality rates. Important VHF agents are Ebola and Marburg viruses (MBGV/EBOV), Lassa virus (LASV), Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), dengue virus (DENV), and yellow fever virus (YFV). VHFs are clinically difficult to diagnose and to distinguish; a rapid and reliable laboratory diagnosis is required in suspected cases. We have established six one-step, real-time reverse transcription-PCR assays for these pathogens based on the Superscript reverse transcriptase-Platinum Taq polymerase enzyme mixture. Novel primers and/or 5'-nuclease detection probes were designed for RVFV, DENV, YFV, and CCHFV by using the latest DNA database entries. PCR products were detected in real time on a LightCycler instrument by using 5'-nuclease technology (RVFV, DENV, and YFV) or SybrGreen dye intercalation (MBGV/EBOV, LASV, and CCHFV). The inhibitory effect of SybrGreen on reverse transcription was overcome by initial immobilization of the dye in the reaction capillaries. Universal cycling conditions for SybrGreen and 5'-nuclease probe detection were established. Thus, up to three assays could be performed in parallel, facilitating rapid testing for several pathogens. All assays were thoroughly optimized and validated in terms of analytical sensitivity by using in vitro-transcribed RNA. The >or=95% detection limits as determined by probit regression analysis ranged from 1,545 to 2,835 viral genome equivalents/ml of serum (8.6 to 16 RNA copies per assay). The suitability of the assays was exemplified by detection and quantification of viral RNA in serum samples of VHF patients."

Climate warming can increase pathogen development and survival rates, disease transmission, and host susceptibility. Although most host-parasite systems are predicted to experience more frequent or severe disease impacts with warming, a subset of pathogens might decline with warming, releasing hosts from disease. Recently, changes in El Niño-Southern Oscillation events have had a detectable influence on marine and terrestrial pathogens, including coral diseases, oyster pathogens, crop pathogens, Rift Valley fever, and human cholera. To improve our ability to predict epidemics in wild populations, it will be necessary to separate the independent and interactive effects of multiple climate drivers on disease impact."
"Clinical and diagnostic laboratory immunology","Reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) for diagnosis of Rift Valley fever (RVF) was evaluated by using 293 human and animal sera sampled during an RVF outbreak in Mauritania in 1998. Results of the RT-PCR diagnostic method were compared with those of virus isolation (VI) and detection of immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies. Our results showed that RT-PCR is a specific, sensitive tool for RVF diagnosis in the early phase of the disease and that its results do not differ significantly from those obtained by VI. Moreover, the combined results of RT-PCR and IgM antibody detection were in 100% concordance with the results of VI."
"Revue scientifique et technique (International Office of Epizootics)","The prompt detection and effective management of infectious disease in wildlife rely greatly on field diagnosis. Although clinical work is sometimes of value, the cornerstone of diagnosis is pathological examination (gross necropsy with supporting laboratory investigations). The approach and rationale to gross post-mortem examination are common to all species, despite possible significant differences in technique. Likewise, the principles of sampling are usually comparable, with emphasis on standardisation, the correct use of equipment, and consistency in methods of storage and transportation of specimens. However, the type of sample taken and the laboratory tests required differ, depending upon the circumstances and possible diagnosis. Retention of material is always important. The principles of diagnostic pathology are discussed, with reference to selected diseases, namely: mycobacteriosis, Rift Valley fever, rabies, spongiform encephalopathies, morbillivirus and poxvirus infections, viral encephalitides, West Nile virus infection and chytridiomycosis. The importance of being able to perform certain investigations in the field, efficiently and safely, is emphasised."
"Journal of medical entomology","As part of an evaluation of potential vectors of arboviruses during a Rift Valley fever (RVF) outbreak in the Nile Valley of Egypt in August 1993, we collected mosquitoes in villages with known RVF viral activity. Mosquitoes were sorted to species, pooled, and processed for virus isolation both by intracerebral inoculation into suckling mice and by inoculation into cell culture. A total of 33 virus isolates was made from 36,024 mosquitoes. Viruses were initially identified by indirect fluorescent antibody testing and consisted of 30 flaviviruses (all members of the Japanese encephalitis complex, most probably West Nile [WN] virus) and three alphaviruses (all members of western equine encephalitis complex, most probably Sindbis). The identity of selected viruses was confirmed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and sequencing. Culex antennatus (Becker) and Culex perexiguus Theobald accounted for five (17%) and 23 (77%) of the WN virus isolations, respectively. Despite isolation of viruses from 32 pools of mosquitoes (both WN and Sindbis viruses were isolated from a single pool), RVF virus was not isolated from these mosquitoes, even though most of them are known competent vectors collected during an ongoing RVF outbreak. Thus, it should be remembered, that even during a known arbovirus outbreak, other arboviruses may still be circulating and causing disease."
"Emerging infectious diseases","In December 1997, 170 hemorrhagic fever-associated deaths were reported in Garissa District, Kenya. Laboratory testing identified evidence of acute Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV). Of the 171 persons enrolled in a cross-sectional study, 31(18%) were anti-RVFV immunoglobulin (Ig) M positive. An age-adjusted IgM antibody prevalence of 14% was estimated for the district. We estimate approximately 27,500 infections occurred in Garissa District, making this the largest recorded outbreak of RVFV in East Africa. In multivariable analysis, contact with sheep body fluids and sheltering livestock in one s home were significantly associated with infection. Direct contact with animals, particularly contact with sheep body fluids, was the most important modifiable risk factor for RVFV infection. Public education during epizootics may reduce human illness and deaths associated with future outbreaks."
"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","Bunyaviruses replicate in the cytoplasm of infected cells. New viral particles are formed by budding of nucleocapsids into the Golgi apparatus. We have previously shown that the IFN-induced human MxA protein inhibits bunyavirus replication by an unknown mechanism. Here we demonstrate that MxA binds to the nucleocapsid protein of La Crosse virus (LACV) and colocalizes with the viral protein in cytoplasmic complexes. Electron microscopy revealed that these complexes accumulated in the perinuclear area and consisted of highly ordered fibrillary structures. A similar MxA-mediated redistribution of viral nucleocapsid proteins was detected with other bunyaviruses, such as Bunyamwera virus and Rift Valley fever virus. MxA(E645R), a carboxy-terminal mutant of MxA without antiviral activity against LACV, did not lead to complex formation. Wild-type MxA, but not MxA(E645R), was able to bind to LACV nucleocapsid protein in coimmunoprecipitation assays, demonstrating the importance of the carboxy-terminal effector domain of MxA. These results illustrate an efficient mechanism of IFN action whereby an essential virus component is trapped in cytoplasmic inclusions and becomes unavailable for the generation of new virus particles."
"Virology","In late 1997 and early 1998, a large outbreak of hemorrhagic fever occurred in East Africa. Clinical samples were collected in Kenya and southern Somalia, and 27 of 115 (23%) hemorrhagic fever patients tested showed evidence of acute infection with Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus as determined by IgM detection, virus isolation, detection of virus RNA by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), or immunohistochemistry. However, two patients (one from Kenya and the other from Somalia) whose illness met the hemorrhagic fever case definition yielded virus isolates that were not RVF. Electron microscopy suggested these two virus isolates were members of the family Bunyaviridae. RT-PCR primers were designed to detect bunyavirus RNA in these samples. Regions of the S and L segments of the two isolates were successfully amplified, and their nucleotide sequences exhibited nearly complete identity with Bunyamwera virus, a mosquito-borne virus not previously associated with severe human disease. Unexpectedly, the virus M segment appeared to be reassorted, as the sequences detected exhibited 32-33% nucleotide and 28% amino acid differences relative to the corresponding M segment sequence of Bunyamwera virus. The association of this reassortant bunyavirus, proposed name Garissa virus, with severe disease is supported by the detection of the virus RNA in acute-phase sera taken from 12 additional hemorrhagic fever cases in the region."
"Bulletin de la Société de pathologie exotique (1990)","An investigation was conducted between 1994 and 1997 in forested areas of the Central African Republic (CAR) to determine the seroprevalence of IgG antibodies against several haemorrhagic fever viruses present in the region. Sera were obtained from 1762 individuals in two groups (Pygmy and Bantu locuted populations) living in 4 forested areas in the south of the country. Sera were tested for IgG antibodies against Ebola, Marburg, Rift Valley fever (RVF), Yellow fever (YF) and Hantaviruses by enzyme immunoassay (EIA), and against Lassa virus by immunofluorescent assay. The prevalence of IgG antibodies was 5.9% for Ebola, 2% for Marburg, 6.9% pour RVF, 6.5% for YF, 2% for Hantaan. No antibodies were detected against Lassa, Seoul, Puumala and Thottapalayam viruses. No IgM antibodies were detected against RVF and YF viruses. The distribution of antibodies appears to be related to tropical rain forest areas. This study indicates that several haemorrhagic fever viruses are endemic in forested areas of the CAR and could emerge due to environmental modification."
"Emerging infectious diseases","A Rift Valley fever outbreak occurred in Mauritania in 1998. Seroepidemiologic and virologic investigation showed active circulation of the Rift Valley fever virus, with 13 strains isolated, and 16% (range 1.5%-38%) immunoglobulin (Ig) M-positivity in sera from 90 humans and 343 animals (sheep, goats, camels, cattle, and donkeys). One human case was fatal."
"Journal of clinical microbiology","The Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), a member of the genus Phlebovirus (family Bunyaviridae) is an enveloped negative-strand RNA virus with a tripartite genome. Until 2000, RVFV circulation was limited to the African continent, but the recent deadly outbreak in the Arabian Peninsula dramatically illustrated the need for rapid diagnostic methods, effective treatments, and prophylaxis. A method for quantifying the small RNA segment by a real-time detection reverse transcription (RT)-PCR using TaqMan technology and targeting the nonstructural protein-coding region was developed, and primers and a probe were designed. After optimization of the amplification reaction and establishment of a calibration curve with synthetic RNA transcribed in vitro from a plasmid containing the gene of interest, real-time RT-PCR was assessed with samples consisting of RVFV from infected Vero cells. The method was found to be specific for RVFV, and it was successfully applied to the detection of the RVFV genome in animal sera infected with RVFV as well as to the assessment of the efficiency of various drugs (ribavirin, alpha interferon, 6-azauridine, and glycyrrhizin) for antiviral activity. Altogether, the results indicated a strong correlation between the infectious virus titer and the amount of viral genome assayed by real time RT-PCR. This novel method could be of great interest for the rapid diagnosis and screening of new antiviral compounds, as it is sensitive and time saving and does not require manipulation of infectious material."
"Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America","This short review covers 6 viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs) that are known to occur in Africa: yellow fever, Rift Valley fever, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, Lassa fever, Marburg virus disease, and Ebola hemorrhagic fever. All of these have at one time or another affected travelers, often the adventurous kind who are ""roughing it"" in rural areas, who should therefore be made aware by their physicians or travel health clinics about their potential risk of exposure to any VHF along their travel route and how to minimize the risk. A significant proportion of VHF cases involving travelers have affected expatriate health care workers who were nosocomially exposed in African hospitals or clinics. The VHFs are associated with a high case-fatality rate but are readily prevented by well-known basic precautions."
"Journal of interferon & cytokine research : the official journal of the International Society for Interferon and Cytokine Research","Mx proteins belong to the interferon (IFN)-induced antiviral defense. The rat genome contains three Mx genes, ratMx1, ratMx2, and ratMx3. The Mx gene products differ in their subcellular localization and antiviral specificity. The nuclear ratMx1 protein confers resistance to influenza A virus, and the cytoplasmic ratMx2 is active against vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), whereas the cytoplasmic ratMx3 protein is antivirally inactive. To investigate the antiviral potential of the rat Mx proteins against arboviruses, a phylogenetically diverse group of viruses that frequently infect rodents, we studied the replication of LaCrosse virus (LACV). Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) (both family Bunyaviridae), and Thogoto virus (THOV) (family Orthomyxoviridae). To that end, we used transfected Vero cells constitutively expressing one of the rat Mx proteins. We observed that the antiviral activity of rat Mx proteins against these arboviruses correlates with their intracellular localization: ratMx1 is active against THOV, which replicates in the nucleus, whereas ratMx2 inhibits bunyaviruses that replicate in the cytoplasm. The results indicate that rats have evolved two Mx proteins to efficiently control viruses with different replication strategies."
"Journal of family & community medicine","Determine the sero-prevalence of rift valley fever (RVF) among slaughterhouse personnel in Makkah during Hajj and define personal and work place correlates.A sample of 294 participants were chosen randomly from slaughterhouse personnel in Makkah during Hajj 1419 (1999). Data were collected through personal interviews using a pre-designed questionnaire consisting of personal and work place variables, e.g. age, nationality, type and hours of work. A blood sample was collected from each participant and tested by enzyme immuno-assay for IgG antibody using killed antigen for rift valley virus.Of the total sample, 17% was seropositive for RVF. The rate of infection varied with country of origin: Syria (10.6%), Egypt (21.2%), Bangladesh (22.6%), Mali (47.1%) and Niger (50%). The number of animals slaughtered per hour and daily hours of work were significantly associated with prevalence of RVF (p<0.05).Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that nationality and daily hours of work predicted 84.1% of the occurrence of RVF.Sero-surveys should be done among slaughterhouse personnel in Saudi Arabia and other countries particularly in countries known to be free from RVF, e.g. Syria and Bangladesh to assess the situation of RVF. The importation of animals from endemic areas should be banned."
"Journal of medical entomology","Surveillance for mosquito-borne viruses was conducted in Barkedji area from 1990 to 1995, following an outbreak of Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus in southern Mauritania. Mosquitoes, sand flies, and midges were collected from human bait and trapped by solid-state U.S. Army battery-powered CDC miniature light traps baited with dry ice or animals (sheep or chickens) at four ponds. Overall, 237,091 male and female mosquitoes representing 52 species in eight genera, 214,967 Phlebotomine sand flies, and 2,527 Culicoides were collected, identified, and tested for arboviruses in 9,490 pools (7,050 pools of female and 331 of male mosquitoes, 2,059 pools of sand flies and 50 pools of Culicoides). Viruses isolated included one Alphavirus, Babanki (BBK); six Flaviviruses, Bagaza (BAG), Ar D 65239, Wesselsbron (WSL), West Nile (WN), Koutango (KOU), Saboya (SAB); two Bunyavirus, Bunyamwera (BUN) and Ngari (NRI); two Phleboviruses, Rift Valley fever (RVF) and Gabek Forest (GF); one Orbivirus, Ar D 66707 (Sanar); one Rhabdovirus, Chandipura (CHP); and one unclassified virus, Ar D 95537. Based on repeated isolations, high field infection rates and abundance, Culex appeared to be the vectors of BAG, BBK, Ar D 65239 (BAG-like), and WN viruses, Ae. vexans and Ae. ochraceus of RVF virus, Mansonia of WN and BAG viruses, Mimomyia of WN and BAG viruses, and Phlebotomine of SAB, CHP, Ar D 95537, and GF viruses. Our data indicate that RVF virus circulated repeatedly in the Barkedji area."
"Cadernos de saúde pública","All known Rift Valley fever(RVF) outbreaks in Kenya from 1950 to 1998 followed periods of abnormally high rainfall. On an interannual scale, periods of above normal rainfall in East Africa are associated with the warm phase of the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon. Anomalous rainfall floods mosquito-breeding habitats called dambos, which contain transovarially infected mosquito eggs. The eggs hatch Aedes mosquitoes that transmit the RVF virus preferentially to livestock and to humans as well. Analysis of historical data on RVF outbreaks and indicators of ENSO (including Pacific and Indian Ocean sea surface temperatures and the Southern Oscillation Index) indicates that more than three quarters of the RVF outbreaks have occurred during warm ENSO event periods. Mapping of ecological conditions using satellite normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data show that areas where outbreaks have occurred during the satellite recording period (1981-1998) show anomalous positive departures in vegetation greenness, an indicator of above-normal precipitation. This is particularly observed in arid areas of East Africa, which are predominantly impacted by this disease. These results indicate a close association between interannual climate variability and RVF outbreaks in Kenya."
"African journal of medicine and medical sciences","Laboratory staff and students were vaccinated with a formalin-inactivated rift valley fever (RVF) vaccine. This study showed that the vaccine used (TSI-GSD 200) was able to bring about the production of antibodies in recipients. For the production of a high titered antibody response, three doses of the vaccine were required. One or two doses of the vaccine did not produce a greater than four-fold rise in antibody titre. A greater than four-fold rise in antibody titre following vaccination, is considered significant. The complete dose of the vaccine, that is, three doses, was necessary for protection. This study also showed that the haemagglutination inhibition (HI) test was capable of detecting antibodies, few weeks post vaccination. Though such HI antibodies broaden with time, it could be used for screening purposes and a more specific test, e.g., plaque reduction neutralisation (PRN) test used for confirmation of such results."

"The Israel Medical Association journal : IMAJ","As the twenty-first century begins it becomes increasingly apparent that the twentieth century, which opened with the promise of the eradication of most infectious diseases, closed with the specter of the reemergence of many deadly infectious diseases that have a rapidly increasing incidence and geographic range. Equally if not more alarming is the appearance of new infectious diseases that have become major sources of morbidity and mortality. Among recent examples are HIV/AIDS, hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, Lyme disease, hemolytic uremic syndrome (caused by a strain of Escherichia coli), Rift Valley fever, Dengue hemorrhagic fever, malaria, cryptosporidiosis, and schistosomiasis. The reasons for this situation are easily identified in some cases as associated with treatment modalities (permissive use of antibiotics), the industrial use of antibiotics, demographic changes, societal behavior patterns, changes in ecology, global warming, the inability to deliver minimal health care and the neglect of well-established public health priorities. In addition is the emergence of diseases of another type. We have begun to characterize the potential microbial etiology of what has historically been referred to as chronic diseases."

The possible role of Cx. poicilipes as an RVF vector is discussed regarding its biology and ecology."
"The Journal of general virology","A transcription system for Toscana virus (TOSV) (a member of the family BUNYAVIRIDAE:, genus PHLEBOVIRUS:) was constructed. For in vivo expression, the TOSV transcription system uses the viral N and L proteins and an S-like RNA genome containing the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene in the antisense orientation flanked by the viral genomic 5'- and 3'-terminal S sequences. It was found that the N and L proteins represent the minimal protein requirement for an active transcription complex. To investigate the possibility of reassortment between TOSV and Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), the activity of their polymerase complexes was tested on their heterologous S-like RNA genomes and this showed that both virus complexes were active. Moreover, hybrid transcriptase complexes with protein components originating from the two viruses were tested on both virus templates and only the combination RVFV L + TOSV N on RVFV S-like RNA was found to be active in this assay. These results suggest that virus reassortants might be generated whenever the two viruses infect the same host."

"Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences","The term ""emerging diseases"" has been used recently to refer to different scenarios, all of which indicate changes in the dynamics of disease in the population. Of the OIE List A diseases, major changes have been experienced with rinderpest, peste des petit ruminants (PPR), contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP), foot-and-mouth disease, African swine fever, lumpy skin disease, and Rift Valley fever. Rinderpest represents a success story of the 1990s, thanks to the programs of the Pan African Rinderpest Campaign (PARC). The situation has changed from that of the 1980s when rinderpest was widespread throughout most of Tropical Africa and the Middle East. PPR is a disease that has become of increasing importance throughout Tropical Africa and the Middle East. CBPP, which had previously been reduced to sporadic incidence within endemic areas, invaded new areas, causing heavy mortality. African swine fever has extended to West Africa and to Madagascar, in both regions resulting in heavy losses. Climatic changes in both East and West Africa were associated with an upsurge of Rift Valley fever. Deficiencies in national veterinary services have contributed to failures in early detection and response; in many regions investigation and diagnosis services have deteriorated. The continuing structural adjustment program for national veterinary services will need to take into account their transformation from providers of services (e.g., vaccinations, medicines) to inspection and quality assurance services. Surveillance, early warning, and disease emergency preparedness will need to be pursued more vigorously in Africa and the Middle East as vital components of national veterinary services."
"Revue scientifique et technique (International Office of Epizootics)","Rift Valley fever is the most important bunyaviral disease of animals in Africa. The virus, transmitted by mosquitoes, causes abortions and mortality in young animals in addition to haemorrhagic fevers in humans. Although vaccines against this virus are available, the uses of these vaccines are limited because of deleterious effects or incomplete protection, justifying further studies to improve the existing vaccines or to develop others. Nairobi sheep disease is transmitted by ticks. The disease is endemic in East Africa and sporadic cases are reported in India and Sri Lanka. Other viruses transmitted by mosquitoes or midges are teratogenic in cattle or sheep, these include Akabane and related viruses in Asia, Australia and the Middle East, and Cache Valley in North America. The Marburg and Ebola viruses of the genus Filovirus are associated with epidemics in Central Africa with high fatality rates in humans; some outbreaks were related to contact with monkeys. Another subtype of Ebola virus was first described in a quarantine facility in the United States of America among cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) from the Philippines.

"Journal of virological methods","Rift Valley fever (RVF) is an anthropozoonosis caused by a Phlebovirus (Bunyaviridae family) that has re-emerged recently in East and West Africa in 1997-1998. This emphasizes the need for early and rapid detection of the virus and an efficient surveillance system. To this goal, a single tube or a nested reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method focusing on the NSs coding region of the S segment was developed and used to detect the RVF virus (RVFV) genome, resulting respectively in the synthesis of 810 and 662 bp DNA amplimers. The assay was specific for RVFV and did not amplify any other phleboviruses known to circulate in sub-Saharan Africa. When serial dilutions of RVFV were artificially mixed with human normal serum, the minimal detection limits were 50 and 0.5 plaque forming units respectively using the simple and the nested RT-PCR. The RT-PCR method was efficient for the detection of RVFV RNA in the blood from experimentally RVFV-infected mice and lamb and the nested RT-PCR was found more sensitive than the virus isolation method. Additionally, this detection method was applied successfully for the diagnosis of human cases during the 1998 Mauritanian outbreak."
"Journal of virology","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), a phlebovirus of the family Bunyaviridae, is a major public health threat in Egypt and sub-Saharan Africa. The viral and host cellular factors that contribute to RVFV virulence and pathogenicity are still poorly understood. All pathogenic RVFV strains direct the synthesis of a nonstructural phosphoprotein (NSs) that is encoded by the smallest (S) segment of the tripartite genome and has an undefined accessory function. In this report, we show that MP12 and clone 13, two attenuated RVFV strains with mutations in the NSs gene, were highly virulent in IFNAR(-/-) mice lacking the alpha/beta interferon (IFN-alpha/beta) receptor but remained attenuated in IFN-gamma receptor-deficient mice. Both attenuated strains proved to be excellent inducers of early IFN-alpha/beta production. In contrast, the virulent strain ZH548 failed to induce detectable amounts of IFN-alpha/beta and replicated extensively in both IFN-competent and IFN-deficient mice. Clone 13 has a defective NSs gene with a large in-frame deletion. This defect in the NSs gene results in expression of a truncated protein which is rapidly degraded. To investigate whether the presence of the wild-type NSs gene correlated with inhibition of IFN-alpha/beta production, we infected susceptible IFNAR(-/-) mice with S gene reassortant viruses. When the S segment of ZH548 was replaced by that of clone 13, the resulting reassortants became strong IFN inducers. When the defective S segment of clone 13 was exchanged with the wild-type S segment of ZH548, the reassortant virus lost the capacity to stimulate IFN-alpha/beta production. These results demonstrate that the ability of RVFV to inhibit IFN-alpha/beta production correlates with viral virulence and suggest that the accessory protein NSs is an IFN antagonist."

"The Journal of general virology","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is the causative agent of Rift Valley fever, a widespread disease of domestic animals and humans in sub-Saharan Africa. Laboratory rats have frequently been used as an animal model for studying the pathogenesis of Rift Valley fever. It is shown here that Lewis rats (LEW/mol) are susceptible to infection with RVFV, whereas Wistar-Furth (WF/mol) rats are resistant to RVFV infection. LEW/mol rats developed acute hepatitis and died after infection with RVFV strain ZH548, whereas WF/mol rats survived the infection. Cross-breeding of resistant WF/mol rats with susceptible LEW/mol rats demonstrated that resistance is segregated as a single dominant gene. Primary hepatocytes but not glial cells from WF/mol rats showed the resistant phenotype in cell culture, indicating that resistance was cell type-specific. Moreover, when cultured hepatocytes were stimulated with interferon (IFN) type I there was no indication of a regulatory role of IFN in the RVFV-resistance gene expression in WF/mol rats. Interestingly, previous reports have shown that LEW rats from a different breeding stock (LEW/mai) are resistant to RVFV infections, whereas WF/mai rats are susceptible. Thus, inbred rat strains seem to differ in virus susceptibility depending on their breeding histories. A better genetic characterization of inbred rat strains and a revision in nomenclature is needed to improve animal experimentation in the future."

"The Journal of general virology","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is an arbovirus of the BUNYAVIRIDAE: family, causing recurrent disease outbreaks in Africa. Natural vertebrate hosts include cattle and humans. Several mosquito species belonging to the AEDES: and CULEX: genera act as vectors of this phlebovirus. To test whether pathogen-derived resistance against RVFV could be induced by expressing genomic sequences in mosquito cells, as has been shown for La Crosse and dengue 2 viruses, we generated various recombinant Semliki Forest viruses expressing the S segment (or its genes) in the genomic or antigenomic sense. Expression of the N but not the NSs gene interfered with the production of RVFV in mosquito cells and this phenomenon was RNA- but not protein-dependent. These results raise questions on the molecular mechanisms involved in virus resistance."
"Blood coagulation & fibrinolysis : an international journal in haemostasis and thrombosis","Viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF) denotes a virus-induced acute febrile, hemorrhagic disease reported from wide areas of the world. Hemorrhagic fever (HF) viruses are encapsulated, single-stranded RNA viruses that are associated with insect or rodent vectors whose interaction with humans defines the mode of disease transmission. There are 14 HF viruses, which belong to four viral families: Arenaviridae, Bunyaviridae, Filoviridae and Flaviviridae. This review presents, in order, the following aspects of VHF: (1) epidemiology, (2) anomalies of platelets and coagulation factors, (3) vasculopathy, (4) animal models of VHFs, (5) pathogenic mechanisms, and (6) treatment and future studies. HF viruses produce the manifestations of VHFs either by direct effects on cellular functions or by activation of immune and inflammatory pathways. In Lassa fever, Rift Valley fever and Crimean-Congo HF, the main feature of fatal illness appears to be impaired/delayed cellular immunity, which leads to unchecked viremia. However, in HF with renal syndrome and dengue HF, the immune response plays an active role in disease pathogenesis. The interplay of hemostasis, immune response, and inflammation is very complex. Molecular biologic techniques and the use of animal models have helped to unravel some of these interactions."

Female participants were more likely to have been infected than male. Persons living within 2 km of the treatment plant were more likely to have been infected with West Nile (p=0.016) and sandfly Sicilian (p=0.010) viruses. Raising domestic animals within the house was a risk factor for sandfly Sicilian (p=0.003) but not for sandfly Naples virus (p=0.148). All serum samples were negative for IgM antibodies against the tested viruses. Our study is the first documentation of West Nile and sandfly viruses in Jordan and calls attention to the possible health hazards of living close to wastewater treatment plants and their effluent channels."
"Médecine tropicale : revue du Corps de santé colonial","A few million years ago, when primates moved from the east African forest to the savannah, they were already infected with endogenous viruses and occultly transmitted them to the prime Homo species. However it was much later with the building of the first large cities in Mesopotamia that interhuman viral transmission began in earnest. Spreading was further enhanced with the organization of the Egyptian, Greek, Roman, and Arab empires around the Mediterranean. Discovery of the New World in 1492 led to an unprecedented clash of civilizations and the destruction of pre-Columbian Indian civilizations. It also led to a rapid spread of viruses across the Atlantic Ocean with the emergence of yellow fever and appearance of smallpox and measles throughout the world. However the greatest opportunities for worldwide viral development have been created by our present, modern civilization. This fact is illustrated by epidemic outbreaks of human immunodeficiency virus, Venezuela hemorrhagic fever, Rift valley fever virus, and monkey pox virus. Close analysis underscores the major role of human intervention in producing these events."
"Microbes and infection / Institut Pasteur","Wild rodents (214) of fourteen species were trapped at seven sites in Senegal. Arvicanthis niloticus and Mastomys erythroleucus were among the most frequently collected species (77.2% of total capture). All rodents were examined for the presence of anti-Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) antibody; the prevalence over all sampled species was 3.8%, varying widely with respect to species and location. Four of 14 species of rodents were found to have anti-RVFV antibodies: Rattus rattus (one positive of two tested) Mastomys huberti (13.5%), A. niloticus (4.3%), and M. erthroleucus (2.4%). The highest prevalence of anti-RVFV antibody was recorded within the enzootic area of the Senegal River delta, at Richard Toll (9.6%). A. niloticus and M. erythroleucus and a strain of laboratory-bred mice were experimentally inoculated with two strains of RVFV and examined for viremia, illness, seroconversion and mortality. A. niloticus and M. erythroleucus demonstrated a limited resistance to infection, thus potentially allowing for the replication of virus in these animals and making these species possible candidates as hosts in the maintenance cycle of RVFV in nature."
"Journal of wildlife diseases","Two hundred and eighty one serum samples collected from free-ranging black (Diceros bicornis) and white (Ceratotherium simum) rhinoceros, in the Republic of South Africa (RSA), Namibia, and Kenya from 1987-97, were examined for antibody to 16 different infectious agents. Positive antibody titers were detected against Akabane (59.8%), bluetongue (55%), African horse sickness (27.9%), epizootic haemorrhagic disease of deer (19.4%), parainfluenza type 3 (25.3%), bovine herpes virus 1 (3.1%), equine herpes virus 1 (8.8%) and bovine viral diarrhea (1.2%) viruses, and four serovars of Leptospira interrogans, (ranging 1.2 to 8.8%). No antibody was detected against Rift Valley fever virus, encephalomyocarditis virus, Brucella abortus, and Trypanosoma equiperdum. Interspecies differences were detected for African horse sickness, epizootic haemorrhagic disease of deer and parainfluenza type 3 viruses. There appeared to be some geographic variation in the prevalence of antibody for African horse sickness, bluetongue, epizootic haemorrhagic disease of deer, parainfluenza type 3, equine herpes virus 1 and Leptospira interrogans serovar bratislava."
"The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene","West Nile virus is a mosquito borne flavivirus endemic over a large geographic area including Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. Although the virus generally causes a mild, self-limiting febrile illness in humans, it has sporadically caused central nervous system infections during epidemics. An isolate of West Nile virus was obtained from a pool of four male Culex univittatus complex mosquitoes while we were conducting an investigation of Rift Valley fever along the Kenya-Uganda border in February-March 1998. This represents the first field isolation of West Nile virus from male mosquitoes and strongly suggests that vertical transmission of the virus occurs in the primary maintenance mosquito vector in Kenya. A phylogenetic analysis of the complete amino acid sequence of the viral envelope glycoprotein demonstrated a sister relationship with a Culex pipiens mosquito isolate from Romania made in 1996. This unexpected finding probably reflects the role of migratory birds in disseminating West Nile virus between Africa and Europe."
"East African medical journal","To assess the prevalence of anaemia in outpatients attending a rural health clinic in an area of seasonal malaria, during the low transmission season.Haemoglobin estimation and blood slide examination for malaria parasites were performed on 280 consecutive patients attending outpatient curative services at Entasopia Health Centre, Kajiado District, Kenya, between April-May 1996. Anaemia was defined according to World Health Organisation guidelines for age, sex and pregnancy status.In all groups except adult males, more than half of the patients tested had haemoglobin values below the lower reference limits, suggesting that anaemia is widely present in this population even during the low malaria season. Only 5% of patients were positive for Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Peripheral blood film examination suggested iron deficiency as the major cause of anaemia.Further studies to define the underlying causes of anaemia and to develop community strategies to prevent anaemia are required. The association between fever and anaemia and the use of pallor to diagnose anaemia, are discussed."
"Bulletin de la Société de pathologie exotique (1990)","In the early 20th century, when it was discovered that the yellow fever virus was transmitted in its urban cycle by Aedes aegypti, measures of control were introduced leading to its disappearance. Progressive neglect of the disease, however, led to a new outbreak in 1927 during which the etiological agent was isolated; some years later a vaccine was discovered and yellow fever disappeared again. In the 1960s, rare cases of encephalitis were observed in young children after vaccination and the administration of the vaccine was forbidden for children under 10 years. Five years later, a new outbreak of yellow fever in Diourbel, Senegal, was linked to the presence of Aedes aegypti. In the late 1970s, the idea of a selvatic cycle for yellow fever arose. Thanks to new investigative techniques in Senegal and Côte d'Ivoire, the yellow fever virus was isolated from the reservoir of virus and vectors. The isolated virus was identified in monkeys and several vectors: Aedes furcifer, Aedes taylori, Aedes luteocephalus. Most importantly, the virus was isolated in male mosquitoes. Until recently, the only known cycle had been that of Haddow in East Africa. The virus circulate in the canopea between monkeys and Aedes africanus. These monkeys infect Aedes bromeliae when they come to eat in banana plantations. This cycle does not occur in West Africa. Vertical transmission is the main method of maintenance of the virus through the dry season. ""Reservoirs of virus"" are often mentioned in medical literature, monkeys having a short viremia whereas mosquitoes remain infected throughout their life cycle. In such a selvatic cycle, circulation can reach very high levels and no child would be able to escape an infecting bite and yet no clinical cases of yellow fever have been reported. The virulence--as it affects man--of the yellow fever virus in its wild cycle is very low. In areas where the virus can circulate in epidemic form, two types of circulation can be distinguished. Intermediate yellow fever--a term coined to define epidemia which do not correspond exactly to urban yellow fever. The cycle involves men and monkeys through wild vectors as Aedes furcifer but also through Aedes aegypti and the mortality rate is much lower than for urban epidemics. In urban yellow fever, man is the only vertebrate host involved in the circulation of the virus, the vector being generally Aedes aegypti. This vector maintains a selective pressure, increasing the transmission of virus capable of producing high viremia in man. In the selvatic cycles, two cycles can be distinguished: one of maintenance which does not increase the quantity of virus in circulation and one of amplification which does increase this quantity. As we shall see, it develops into an epizootic form but also in an epidemic form in man. When the decrease in yellow fevers across Africa is considered, it appears that all major epidemics occur in West Africa inspite of the presence of wild cycles of the yellow fever virus in Central and East Africa. For the rare epidemics that have occurred there, the vector has never been Aedes aegypti. In a recent outbreak in Kenya, the vector was Aedes bromeliae. The examination of part of the gene encoding for envelope protein showed the presence of two geographical types corresponding to West-Africa and Central East-Africa. Clinically speaking, yellow fever is an haemorrhagic fever with hepatitis similar to other haemorrhagic fevers such as Rift Valley fever. When, in 1987, an outbreak of haemorrhagic fever occurred in southern Mauritania, for several days it was thought to be yellow fever. Four days later, the diagnosis was corrected by isolating and identifying the virus as that of Rift Valley fever (RVFV). RVFV causes several pathogenic syndromes in human beings: acute febrile illness, haemorrhagic fever, haemorrhagic fever with hepatitis, nervous syndromes or ocular disease. Mortality rate was high for haemorrhagic fever with hepatitis, reaching 36%. (ABST"
"The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene","In February 1998, an outbreak of acute febrile illness was reported from the Kapalata military camp in Kisangani, the Democratic Republic of Congo. The illness was characterized by an acute onset of fever associated with severe headache, arthralgia, backache, neurologic signs, abdominal pain, and coughing. In 1 individual, hemorrhagic manifestations were observed. The neurologic signs included an altered level of consciousness, convulsions, and coma. Malaria was initially suspected, but the patients showed negative blood films and failed to respond to antimicrobial drugs. A total of 35 sera collected from the military patients in the acute phase were tested for the presence of IgM against vector-borne agents. Serum IgM antibodies against West Nile fever virus were found in 23 patients (66%), against Chikungunya virus in 12 patients (34%), against dengue virus in 1 patient (3%), and against Rickettsia typhi in 1 patient (3%). All sera were negative for IgM antibody against Rift Valley fever virus, Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, and Sindbis virus. These data suggest that infections with West Nile fever virus have been the main cause of the outbreak."
"Journal of virology","Unlike all the other Rift Valley fever virus strains (Bunyaviridae, Phlebovirus) studied so far, clone 13, a naturally attenuated virus, does not form the filaments composed of the NSs nonstructural protein in the nuclei of infected cells (R. Muller, J. F. Saluzzo, N. Lopez, T. Drier, M. Turell, J. Smith, and M. Bouloy, Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 53:405-411, 1995). This defect is correlated with a large in-frame deletion in the NSs coding region of the S segment of the tripartite genome. Here, we show that the truncated NSs protein of clone 13 is expressed and remains in the cytoplasm, where it is degraded rapidly by the proteasome. Through the analysis of reassortants between clone 13 and a virulent strain, we localized the marker(s) of attenuation in the S segment of this attenuated virus. This result raises questions regarding the role of NSs in pathogenesis and highlights, for the first time in the Bunyaviridae family, a major role of the S segment in virulence and attenuation, possibly associated with a defect in the nonstructural protein."
"Journal of medical entomology","In 1993, Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus reappeared in Egypt. We determined the prevalence and feeding patterns of mosquitoes in 5 villages where the virus was active. Of 10 species recovered, Aedes caspius (Pallas), Culex pipiens L., Cx. antennatus (Becker), and Cx. perexiguus Theobald constituted 99% of > 35,000 mosquitoes captured in dry ice-baited CDC light traps. Ae. caspius was most prevalent, except at Nag' El Hagar where it was replaced by Cx. perexiguus. Cx. pipiens ranked 2nd, except at Nag' El Ghuneimiya, where it was replaced by Cx. antennatus. Most blood meals analyzed by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reacted to > or = 1 antiserum. Cx. pipiens was mainly anthropophagic, and therefore may have been the main vector of RVF virus among humans. Ae. caspius feeds were chiefly from humans, bovines, and equines. Cx. antennatus and Cx. perexiguus fed generally on bovines. Mixed blood meals from humans and RVF virus susceptible animals were identified in the predominant mosquitoes. Prevalence and host selection, as well as predicted probability for a blood meal being interrupted, indicated that Ae. caspius may have served as a bridge vector between humans and bovines in 4 of the villages. Cx. perexiguus may have played this role at Nag' El Hagar. Because potential vectors are abundant, susceptible domestic animals are associated closely with humans, and surveillance of imported livestock is not systematic, we conclude that RVF virus sporadically will recur in Egypt."
"Revue scientifique et technique (International Office of Epizootics)","An epizootic of Rift Valley fever (RVF) occurred in Egypt between April and August 1997. The signs among infected cattle and sheep were high fever, icterus, bloody diarrhoea and abortion. Aborted sheep foetuses and sera from the affected herds were collected in the Aswan and Assiut Provinces, Upper Egypt, for virological and serological examination. A cytopathic effect was detected in Vero cell cultures 48 h after inoculation with the foetal liver and spleen suspensions. The same suspensions caused paralysis and mortalities two to three days post intracerebral injection in mice. The isolated virus was identified using an agar gel precipitation test (AGPT) and a direct fluorescent antibody technique. Serological examination revealed that all tested sheep (57) and cattle (93) gave positive results to serological tests, using a complement fixation (CF), serum neutralisation (SN) and indirect immunofluorescence assay; while only 48 (84.2%) out of 57 sheep sera and 69 (74.2%) out of 93 cattle sera gave positive results using an AGPT. Titration of the serum samples indicated that SN is more sensitive than CF. Importation of infected ruminants, especially camels from the Sudan, is the principal source of infection. Aswan, the nearest Egyptian province to the Sudan, is the focus of RVF virus infection in Egypt. As a result of high insect populations, the epizootics of RVF have usually occurred during the summer in Egypt. Reoccurrence of epizootics from time to time indicates failure of the applied RVF vaccination programme in Egypt."
"The Onderstepoort journal of veterinary research","The inter-epizootic reservoir host of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) remains unknown, although the namaqua rock rat, Aethomys namaquensis, as well as bats have been implicated. Bats can be asymptomatically infected with rabies, as well as several arboviruses; the possibility that they can act as host for RVFV therefore exists. To examine this possibility, 350 different samples (brain, liver, salivary glands and brown fat) obtained from 150 bats (comprising seven species) were tested for RVFV antigen using an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). None of the samples tested positive, but the ELISA proved to have limited sensitivity (> or = 10(3) TCID50/ml). In order to determine whether bats could be infected with RVFV, one Miniopterus schreibersii and two Eptesicus capensis bats were inoculated by the oral or intramuscular route with 100 ml and 30 ml, respectively, of a RVFV suspension with a titre of 10(6) TCID50/ml. None of the bats developed any clinical signs. A low concentration of RVFV antigen was found in the liver and urine of M. schreibersii, but not in brain tissue. A third E. capensis bat was inoculated by the intramuscular route and sacrificed on day 18. A low level of antigen was detected in the brown fat. These results demonstrate that bats can be infected with RVFV, and that further studies should be done to determine the potential of different bat species to act as reservoir hosts for RVFV during inter-epizootic periods."
"Virology","The S segment of Rift Valley fever virus (Bunyaviridae, Phlebovirus) codes for two proteins, the nucleoprotein N and the nonstructural protein NSs. The NSs protein is a phosphoprotein of unknown function that is localized in the cytoplasm and the nuclei of infected cells where it forms filamentous structures. To characterize further the protein expressed in VC10 cells infected with the MP12 strain, we analyzed its phosphorylation states and showed that phosphorylated forms were found in both compartments. Cytoplasmic and nuclear NSs were phosphorylated only at serine residues. Phosphopeptide mapping and molecular analysis of mutants obtained by site-directed mutagenesis allowed us to map the major phosphorylation sites of nuclear and cytoplasmic forms of NSs to serine residues 252 and 256, located at the carboxy-terminus in consensus sequences for casein kinase II. A similar map was obtained when the protein was purified from mosquito cells infected with MP12. In addition, we showed that the purified unphosphorylated NSs protein expressed from pET-NSs plasmid in a coupled transcription-translation reaction containing Escherichia coli S30 extracts did not possess autophosphorylation activity but was phosphorylated in vitro after incubation with recombinant casein kinase II.Copyright 1999 Academic Press."
"Vaccine","Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus causes serious and fatal disease in animals and man. To protect personnel who work with RVF virus in the laboratory, or troops who may be exposed to this virus, the US Army successfully developed an improved version of inactivated RVF vaccine, TSI-GSD-200. From early 1986 to late 1997, 598 at-risk workers at the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) were vaccinated as part of an occupational safety and health program. The subjects of this study received three subcutaneous doses (0, 7 and 28 days) of 0.5 ml of TSI-GSD-200. A total of 540 vaccinees (90.3%) initially responded (group A) with an 80% plaque-reduction neutralization antibody titer (PRNT80) of > or =1:40; whereas 58 subjects (9.7%) were initial nonresponders (group B) failing to achieve this titer. Volunteers who either failed to respond or who achieved a titer of > or =1:40 but whose titer waned below 1:40 were boosted 1-4 times with the same vaccine. Among 247 group A subjects who received the first recall injection, 242 (98%) were successfully boosted, achieving a PRNT80 > or =1:40. Thirty-three of 44 (75%) initial nonresponders were converted to responder status after the first booster, which is a lower rate than that of group A (P < 0.001). After the primary series and the first booster, Kaplan-Meier analysis showed 50% probability of group A members maintaining a titer of > or =1:40 for approximately eight years; whereas group B had a 50% probability of maintaining a titer for only 204 days. Group A immune response rates to boosts 1-4 ranged from 87 to 100% with geometric mean titers (GMTs) ranging from 80 to 916. Boosts 1-4 immune response rates of group B volunteers ranged from 67 to 79% with GMTs ranging from 90 to 177. Minor side effects to TSI-GSD-200 were noted in 2.7% of all vaccinees after primaries and 3.5% of all vaccinees who had primaries and up to four boosters. We conclude that the use of TSI-GSD-200 is safe and provides good long-term immunity in humans when the primary series and one boost are administered."
"Tropical medicine & international health : TM & IH","After the Rift valley fever (RVF) epidemic of 1987 in the Senegal River Basin, RVF surveillance based on serosurveys has been conducted for 10 years. Serum samples were obtained from 1336 persons and from sheep and goats in selected areas, and these were tested for IgG/IgM RVF antibodies by ELISA. After a period of regular decrease in RVF prevalence in domestic animals until 1993, an epizootic was observed in all herds in 1994-95 with increases in IgM levels and abortions. During the same period, no human cases or RVF IgM were detected. The RVF IgG prevalence significantly correlated with date of birth: children born after 1987 have a low prevalence (5%) in clear contrast to the older population (25.3%) in Podor district. A retrospective analysis of rainfall and RVF prevalence in small domestic animals over the last 10 years showed that the re-emergence correlated with heavy rainfall. A general analysis of the risk of re-emergence and the efficiency of this RVF surveillance system are presented."
"Journal of virology","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), a phlebovirus of the Bunyaviridae family, is an arthropod-borne virus which emerges periodically throughout Africa, emphasizing that it poses a major threat for animal and human populations. To assess the genetic variability of RVFV, several isolates from diverse localities of Africa were investigated by means of reverse transcription-PCR followed by direct sequencing of a region of the small (S), medium (M), and large (L) genomic segments. Phylogenetic analysis showed the existence of three major lineages corresponding to geographic variants from West Africa, Egypt, and Central-East Africa. However, incongruences detected between the L, M, and S phylogenies suggested that genetic exchange via reassortment occurred between strains from different lineages. This hypothesis, depicted by parallel phylogenies, was further confirmed by statistical tests. Our findings, which strongly suggest exchanges between strains from areas of endemicity in West and East Africa, strengthen the potential existence of a sylvatic cycle in the tropical rain forest. This also emphasizes the risk of generating uncontrolled chimeric viruses by using live attenuated vaccines in areas of endemicity."

Analysis of this record and Pacific and Indian Ocean sea surface temperature anomalies, coupled with satellite normalized difference vegetation index data, shows that prediction of Rift Valley fever outbreaks may be made up to 5 months in advance of outbreaks in East Africa. Concurrent near-real-time monitoring with satellite normalized difference vegetation data may identify actual affected areas."
"Journal of virology","The ambisense S segment of Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus (a phlebovirus in the Bunyaviridae family) codes for two proteins: the viral complementary-sense RNA for the N nucleoprotein and the genomic-sense RNA for the nonstructural protein NSs. Except for the fact that the NSs protein is phosphorylated and forms filamentous structures in the nuclei of infected cells (R. Swanepoel and N. K. Blackburn, J. Gen. Virol. 34:557-561, 1977), its role is poorly understood, especially since the replication cycle of all these viruses takes place in the cytoplasm. To investigate the mechanisms involved in filament formation, we expressed NSs in mammalian cells via a recombinant Semliki Forest virus and demonstrated that the protein alone was able to form structures similar to those observed in RVF virus-infected cells, indicating that the presence of other RVF virus proteins is not required for filament formation. The yeast two-hybrid system was used to show that the protein interacts with itself and to map the interacting domains. Various deletion and substitution mutants were constructed, and the mutant proteins were analyzed by immunoprecipitation, Western blotting and immunofluorescence. These experiments indicated that the 10 to 17 amino acids of the carboxy-terminal domain were involved in self-association of the protein and that deletion of this acidic carboxy-terminal domain prevents the protein from forming filaments but does not affect its nuclear localization. The role of two phosphorylation sites present in this domain was also investigated, but they were not found to have a major influence on the formation of the nuclear filament."
"Revue scientifique et technique (International Office of Epizootics)","In 1994, the Food and Agriculture Organization undertook to revitalise its activities in the control of transboundary animal disease by establishing a new special programme known as the Emergency Prevention System (EMPRES) against transboundary animal and plant pests and diseases. The emphasis of the EMPRES livestock component is placed on pre-empting outbreaks and losses experienced by agriculture through the enhancement of local capacity to detect and react rapidly to plague events. EMPRES concentrates on the co-ordination of the Global Rinderpest Eradication Programme--a time-bound eradication programme--whilst addressing the progressive control of the most serious epidemic diseases within a broad framework of emergency preparedness. Programme activities are discussed in relation to early warning, early reaction, facilitating research and co-ordination. In addition to rinderpest, particular attention has been paid to contagious bovine pleuropneumonia, a re-emerging disease in Africa targeted for strategic attention, and foot and mouth disease, for which co-ordinated regional control in Latin America and South-East Asia has been initiated. Tactical responses to other disease emergencies such as African swine fever, classical swine fever (hog cholera), Rift Valley fever, peste des petits ruminants and lumpy skin disease are described."
"Revue scientifique et technique (International Office of Epizootics)","The animal health situation in the Middle East is particularly unfavourable, in that this area is significantly exposed to many serious animal diseases. Typical factors which contribute to this situation are illustrated with reference to an outbreak of Rift Valley fever in Egypt from 1977 to 1980. The Middle East is ill prepared to institute disease prevention and control measures, due to deficiencies at both national and regional levels. Early disease detection, diagnosis and reporting must become a priority, both within these countries and among them. The author describes several regional animal health programmes which are supported by international institutions and underlines their respective importance."
"Revue scientifique et technique (International Office of Epizootics)","Emergency preparedness planning for animal diseases is a relatively new concept that is only now being applied in Africa. Information can be drawn from numerous recent disease epidemics involving rinderpest, contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP) and Rift Valley fever. These examples clearly demonstrate the shortcomings and value of effective early warning with ensured early reaction in the control of transboundary animal disease events. In concert, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), through the Emergency Prevention-System for Transboundary Animal and Plant Pests and Diseases (EMPRES), and Organisation of African Unity/Inter-African Bureau for Animal Resources (OAU/IBAR), through the European Commission-funded Pan-African Rinderpest Campaign (PARC), have been actively promoting the concepts and application of emergency preparedness planning and should continue to do so under the proposed successor of PARC, namely: the Pan-African Programme for the Control of Epizootics (PACE). The potential partnership between the normative function of the FAO in developing and promoting emergency preparedness and the implementation of improved national and regional disease surveillance by PACE and other partners could witness the commencement of more progressive control of epidemic diseases in Africa and greater self-reliance by African countries in coping with transboundary animal disease emergencies."

"Journal of medical entomology","Studies were conducted to determine the effect of environmental temperature on the susceptibility of Culex pipiens (L.) to Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus. Larval rearing temperature (13, 17, 19, or 26 degrees C) did not affect the susceptibility of adult female Cx. pipiens to infection with RVF virus. In contrast, the adult holding temperature after a viremic blood meal affected infection rates in females. Significantly fewer mosquitoes contained detectable virus when they were held at cooler temperatures, 13 degrees C (10%), 17 degrees C (20%), and 19 degrees C (41%) than at a warmer temperature, 26 degrees C (91%). For mosquitoes held at 13 degrees C and then switched to 26 degrees C, infection rates increased steadily with increased time at 26 degrees C. There was no effect on the ability to detect RVF virus in adult females that were subjected to cooler holding temperature (17 degrees C) after they were first held at warmer temperature (26 degrees C). The role of environmental temperature needs to be considered in studies on the epidemiology of arthropod-borne viruses."

Studies on molecular epidemiology undertaken to better understand the factors leading to RVF emergence, have confirmed the mode of circulation of the virus and highlighted probable risks and obstacles for prevention and control. As for several other viral agents, molecular epidemiology is becoming a useful tool in the study of the emergence of RVF as a serious infectious disease."
"Epidemiology and infection","The prevalence of antibody to the viruses of bovine virus diarrhoea (BVD), bovine herpes virus typel (BHV1), rift valley fever (RVF), bovine ephemeral fever (BEF) and bluetongue (BT) and to Leptospira sp. was determined in wildlife populations in Zimbabwe. Evidence of infection with BVD virus was found in 14 of the 16 species examined but was greatest in eland Taurotragus oryx, nyala Tragelaphus angasi and bushbuck Tragelaphus scriptus. Persistent infection with BVD virus was found in 1 of 303 antibody-free eland but not in the smaller sample of 102 antibody-free buffalo Syncerus caffer. Antibody to BHV1 was widespread, being found in 10 of 16 species with the highest prevalence being in buffalo and eland. Antibody to RVF was most prevalent in black rhino Diceros bicornis and white rhino Ceratotherium simum, buffalo and waterbuck Kobus ellipsiprymnus. Both BEF and BT were widespread in all the species examined. Evidence of infection with Leptospira sp. was found in 7 species. Infections were due to up to 3 of 8 different serovars."
"The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene","The first recorded outbreak of yellow fever in Kenya occurred from mid-1992 through March 1993 in the south Kerio Valley, Rift Valley Province. We conducted entomologic studies in February-March 1993 to identify the likely vectors and determine the potential for transmission in the surrounding rural and urban areas. Mosquitoes were collected by landing capture and processed for virus isolation. Container surveys were conducted around human habitation. Transmission was mainly in woodland of varying density, at altitudes of 1,300-1,800 m. The abundance of Aedes africanus in this biotope, and two isolations of virus from pools of this species, suggest that it was the principal vector in the main period of the outbreak. A third isolate was made from a pool of Ae. keniensis, a little-known species that was collected in the same biotope. Other known yellow fever vectors that were collected in the arid parts of the valley may have been involved at an earlier stage of the epidemic. Vervet monkeys and baboons were present in the outbreak area. Peridomestic mosquito species were absent but abundant at urban sites outside the outbreak area. The entomologic and epidemiologic evidence indicate that this was a sylvatic outbreak in which human cases were directly linked to the epizootic and were independent of other human cases. The region of the Kerio Valley is probably subject to recurrent wandering epizootics of yellow fever, although previous episodes of scattered human infection have gone unrecorded. The risk that the disease could emerge as an urban problem in Kenya should not be ignored."
"The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene","Outbreaks of yellow fever (YF) have never been recorded in Kenya. However, in September 1992, cases of hemorrhagic fever (HF) were reported in the Kerio Valley to the Kenya Ministry of Health. Early in 1993, the disease was confirmed as YF and a mass vaccination campaign was initiated. Cases of suspected YF were identified through medical record review and hospital-based disease surveillance by using a clinical case definition. Case-patients were confirmed serologically and virologically. We documented 55 persons with HF from three districts of the Rift Valley Province in the period of September 10, 1992 through March 11, 1993 (attack rate = 27.4/100,000 population). Twenty-six (47%) of the 55 persons had serologic evidence of recent YF infection, and three of these persons were also confirmed by YF virus isolation. No serum was available from the other 29 HF cases. In addition, YF virus was isolated from a person from the epidemic area who had a nonspecific febrile illness but did not meet the case definition. Five patients with confirmed cases of YF died, a case-fatality rate of 19%. Women with confirmed cases of YF were 10.9 times more likely to die than men (P = 0.010, by Fisher's exact test). Of the 26 patients with serologic or virologic evidence of YF, and for whom definite age was known, 21 (81%) were between 10 and 39 years of age, and 19 (73%) were males. All patients with confirmed YF infection lived in rural areas. There was only one instance of multiple cases within a single family, and this was associated with bush-clearing activity. This was the first documented outbreak of YF in Kenya, a classic example of a sylvatic transmission cycle. Surveillance in rural and urban areas outside the vaccination area should be intensified."

Although these vectors differ from the main vectors in East and South Africa, they use the same type of breeding sites and also feed on cattle and sheep. Although enzootic vectors have now been identified in West Africa, the factors causing outbreaks remain unclear."

"MMWR. Morbidity and mortality weekly report","In December 1997, the Kenya Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization (WHO) in Nairobi received reports of 478 unexplained deaths in the North Eastern province of Kenya and southern Somalia. Clinical features included acute onset of fever and headache associated with hemorrhage (hematochezia, hematemesis, and bleeding from other mucosal sites). Local health officials also reported high rates of illness and death resulting from hemorrhage among domestic animals in the area. This report describes the preliminary results of the outbreak investigation and the results of a serologic survey."
"Bulletin de la Société de pathologie exotique (1990)","An arbovirus requires a competent haematophagous arthropod for transmission from one vertebrate to another susceptible host. Air transportations allow quick transfers from place to place and the diffusion of potential vectors or infectious hosts. The merchandise transportation by containers allowed the diffusion of Ae. albopictus from Asia through Africa and America. Emerging arbovirusis may occur in zones where they do not exist. Dengue which originally was located in southeastern Asia, is the most important arbovirusis in the world. The occurrence of dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) in Asia and America, mostly in urban areas, increased the global concern about dengue. Likewise, cases of DHF are not reported in Africa and in the Indian Ocean southwestern islands. The principal vector of dengue, Aedes aegypti, was present during the dengue 1 outbreak in Comoros, in 1993. In the other islands, only few specimens of Ae. aegypti are observed, and described mostly as none anthropophilic forms. The role of Ae. albopictus as vector of dengue was suspected and reported during outbreaks in Seychelles and Réunion island in 1977-1978. Yellow fever, present in Africa mostly in restricted areas, is absent in Asia. Japanese encephalitis considered as an emerging disease in India could expand through the islands. Rift valley fever, with periodic epizootics in domestic ungulates in Africa, was described as a new disease in Madagascar in 1990-1991. Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever is also present in Madagascar. Humans can be infected by vector bite or by handling infectious animal products. The distribution of other viruses (West Nile, Sindbis, Wesselsbron or Chikungunya) is discussed."
"South African medical journal = Suid-Afrikaanse tydskrif vir geneeskunde","The Athenian epidemic of 430-426 BC, at the outbreak of the Peloponnesian War, caused the death of the great statesman, Pericles, decimated the population and contributed significantly to the decline and fall of classical Greece. In his remarkable documentation of the epidemic, Thucydides (who survived the disease) not only left us a clear clinical picture of the pestilence but also identified its infectious nature and the fact that it conferred at least partial immunity on survivors. As confirmed by a large number of scholars who studied the subject, Thucydides' description does not accurately fit any existing disease, but we suggest that analysis of the signs and symptoms, considered in conjunction with significant epidemiological evidence, narrows down the many possibilities to epidemic typhus, plague, arboviral disease (e.g. Rift Valley fever) and smallpox. Typhus and smallpox fit best, but we favour the latter for reasons given. Unless further primary sources of information become available (and this seems most unlikely), productive speculation as to the cause of Thucydides' epidemic has probably reached the end of the road."
"Journal of medical entomology","We evaluated the ability of selected strains of the Australian mosquitoes, Aedes notoscriptus (Skuse), Ae. vigilax (Skuse), Culex annulirostris Skuse, and Cx. quinquefasciatus Say, to function as potential vectors of Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus, should that virus be introduced accidentally into Australia. After feeding on a hamster with a viremia of 10(7) plaque-forming units/ml of blood, Ae. notoscriptus and Cx. annulirostris were the most susceptible, with infection rates of 86 and 55%, respectively. Female Ae. vigilax and Cx. quinquefasciatus also were susceptible, with infection rates of 38 and 30%, respectively. All of these species transmitted RVF virus by bite 7-10 d after intrathoracic inoculation, and all, except Cx. quinquefastiatus (not tested), transmitted RVF virus 10-16 d after oral exposure. The presence of competent mosquito vectors for RVF virus in Australia indicates the potential for RVF virus epizootics to occur should this virus be introduced into Australia."
"Virus research","The MP12 attenuated strain of Rift Valley fever virus was obtained by 12 serial passages of a virulent isolate ZH548 in the presence of 5-fluorouracil (Caplen et al., 1985. Mutagen-directed attenuation of Rift Valley fever virus as a method for vaccine development. J. Gen. Virol., 66, 2271-2277). The comparison of the M segment of the two strains has already been reported by Takehara et al. (Takehara et al., 1989. Identification of mutations in the M RNA of a candidate vaccine strain of Rift Valley fever virus. Virology 169, 452-457). We have completed the comparison and found that altogether a total of nine, 12 and four nucleotides were changed in the L, M and S segments of the two strains, respectively. Three mutations induced amino acid changes in the L protein but none of them was located in the recognized motifs conserved among RNA dependent polymerases. In the S segment, a single change modified an amino acid in the NSs protein and in the M segment, seven of the mutations resulted in amino acid changes in each of the four encoded G1, G2, 14 kDa and 78 kDa proteins. Characterization of the MP12 virus indicated that determinants for attenuation were present in each segment and that they were introduced progressively during the 12 passages in the presence of the mutagen (Saluzzo and Smith, 1990. Use of reassortant viruses to map attenuating and temperature-sensitive mutations of the Rift Valley fever virus MP-12 vaccine. Vaccine 8, 369-375). Passages 4 and 7-9 were found to be essential for introduction of temperature-sensitive lesions and attenuation. In an attempt to correlate some of the mutations with the attenuated or temperature-sensitive phenotypes, we determined by sequencing the passage level at which the different mutations appeared. This work should help to address the question of the role of the viral gene products in Rift Valley fever pathogenesis."
"The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene","Epizootics of Rift Valley fever (RVF) are often associated with periods of heavy rainfall, which are favorable for mosquito vectors. However, in seasons with normal or low rainfall, enzootic circulation occurs, suggesting the existence of a natural host that can act as a cryptic carrier during interepizootic periods. To confirm the role of heavy rainfall in epizootic circulation, and to identify a possible natural host of RVF virus, serum samples from small terrestrial mammals in the Free State and Northern Cape regions of South Africa were collected before and after the 1988 floods. These areas are known to support epizootic circulation of RVF virus. The samples were tested for the presence of RVF virus-specific IgG using an ELISA and positive sera were confirmed by a neutralization test. Forty-seven (15%) of 312 Aethomys namaquensis (Namaqua rock rat) had antibodies to RVF virus. Of these positive sera, nine (6%) of 141 were collected before the floods of 1988 and 38 (22%) of 171 were collected afterwards (P = 0.001). Naive A. namaquensis were inoculated with RVF virus and developed a viremia, but no clinical symptoms, suggesting that they can act as temporary asymptomatic carriers of the virus. These results suggest a role for A. namaquensis as a cryptic carrier for RVF virus during interepizootic periods and support the results of other studies suggesting an amplifying role for heavy rainfall in the circulation of RVF virus."
"The Journal of general virology","Eighteen strains of Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus collected over a period of 38 years and isolated from diverse localities in Africa and from various hosts (human, animal and arthropod) were investigated by RT-PCR followed by sequencing of the NS(S) protein coding region. This region was chosen to analyse variability because, in contrast to the N protein, the NS(S) protein differs in various phleboviruses and there exists an RVF virus (clone 13) in which 70% of the NS(S) ORF is deleted, suggesting that this sequence is under a weak selective pressure. Sequence data indicated that percentage divergence among isolates ranged from 0 to 9.6% at the nucleotide level and from 0 to 9.5% at the amino acid level. Phylogenetic analysis based on the NS(S) gene revealed two major lineages: Egyptian and sub-Saharan. This led to the establishment of the relatedness between strains and insights into the NS(S) protein, the function of which is still undetermined. Alignment of the deduced amino acid sequences indicated that the cysteine residues are conserved, as are several motifs representing potential phosphorylation sites."
"American journal of veterinary research","To examine effects of in utero inoculation with a mutagen-attenuated Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) vaccine (RVF MP-12) on fetal bovids and to assess the safety and efficacy of calfhood vaccination with RVF MP-12.18 pregnant Hereford and Hereford-type cows in the third or fifth month of gestation, their progeny, and 25 calves from cows immunized with RVF MP-12 during pregnancy.Bovine fetuses were inoculated, via laparotomy, with 1 ml of RVF MP-12 containing 5 log10 plaque-forming units (PFU) of virus. Blood was obtained from newborn calves prior to their ingestion of colostrum. Immune-naive calves and calves born to RVF MP-12-vaccinated dams, ranging in age from 2 to 45 days, were vaccinated with RVF MP-12, and some were later challenge exposed with 1 ml of 5.7 log10 PFU of virulent RVFV strain ZH-501. Cows were monitored for viremia and antibody responses and for hematologic and serum biochemical alterations through parturition or abortion.Surviving in utero-vaccinated calves were healthy, with no noticeable defects. Except for 1 vaccine-inoculated fetus that died on postinoculation day 21, all in utero-vaccinated fetuses had serum neutralizing antibody titer > or = 1:20 at the time of delivery. All dams of in utero-vaccinated fetuses also developed neutralizing antibody titer. Calves born to cows vaccinated during gestation did not have antibody at birth, and all but 1 quickly acquired colostral antibody. Postparturient inoculation of immune-naive calves and calves with colostral antibodies resulted in no untoward effects, and all calves with detectable neutralizing antibodies were protected against virulent virus challenge exposure.Fetal death and abortion would be rare even if fetuses were exposed to RVF MP-12. The trauma and complications associated with in utero inoculation do not make this a practical method of immunization. RVF MP-12 was safe, immunogenic, and protective in calves as young as 2 days of age."
"American journal of veterinary research","To examine safety and efficacy of a mutagen attenuated Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) vaccine (RVF MP-12) in cattle.38 pregnant cows, 14 steers, and 10 lactating dairy cows.Pregnant cows in their third, fifth, or eighth month of gestation were vaccinated (1 ml of RVF MP-12 containing 5 log10 plaque-forming units [PFU] of virus) and were monitored daily through parturition for signs of disease, viremia, and immunologic response. Additionally, 10 vaccinated pregnant cows were challenge inoculated with virulent RVFV at post-vaccination day (PVD) 30 and were monitored daily for untoward effects. Ten unvaccinated pregnant cows also were challenge inoculated with virulent RVFV and served as challenge controls. Vaccinated lactating dairy cows were monitored for viremia and virus shedding in the milk through PVD 14. Yearling steers were vaccinated to assess their immunologic response to various doses of vaccine and were challenge inoculated with virulent RVFV at PVD 28 to assess protection.10 of 38 (26.3%) cows vaccinated during pregnancy developed transient postvaccination viremia titer > or = 2.5 log10 PFU/ml of serum. All vaccinated cows delivered live, healthy calves that were RVFV seronegative at birth, but which quickly acquired colostral antibodies. Vaccinated cows and their fetuses were protected when challenge exposed with virulent RVFV at PVD 30, whereas unvaccinated pregnant cows inoculated with RVFV became febrile and viremic, and aborted. Vaccine virus was unsuccessfully sought from milk of lactating dairy cows after vaccination, suggesting that shedding of vaccine virus through milk should not be a concern. Steers, inoculated with tenfold escalating vaccine doses, beginning with 1.0 log10 PFU, were protected against virulent RVFV challenge exposure.RVF MP-12 may be safe and efficacious for use in pregnant or lactating bovids, and a minimal dose of vaccine may provide suitable protection against viremia."
"Virus research","The M RNA segment of Toscana (TOS) phlebovirus was cloned and the complete nucleotide sequence determined. The M RNA segment is 4215 nucleotides in length, and it contains a single major open reading frame (ORF) in the viral-complementary sequence, between nucleotides 18 and 4034, which can encode for a polyprotein of 1339 amino acids (Mr 149 kDa). The viral segment is expressed via a unique mRNA containing 10-14 non-templated nucleotides at the 5' end and it is truncated at the 3' end by about 140 nucleotides in a purine-rich region. In M predicted amino acid sequences, several hydrophobic regions have been identified. They could function as a signal sequence or a transmembrane region for the different proteins. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of M precursor product revealed 38, 36, and 25% identity and 58, 56, and 47% similarity with those of Rift Valley fever (RVF), Punta Toro (PT) and Unkuniemi (UUK) viruses, respectively. Residues conserved among the proteins are mainly located at the COOH-portion of the precursor, while the major divergence is in the NSm coding regions. Based on sequence comparison and similarity of hydropathic pattern of TOS M segment with other phleboviruses the N-termini of TOS GN and GC glycoproteins were placed at residues 297 and 936 of the precursor."
"Molecular phylogenetics and evolution","The genus Tospovirus was thought to be composed only of the tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV), but now at least four Tospovirus species have been proposed based on serological and molecular data. A classification of tospoviruses has been proposed taking into account global similarities of the N gene and N protein sequences of 7 isolates of Tospovirus. Because phylogenetic analyses based on global similarities can lead to classifications which do not mirror the genealogy of the group, we have employed a cladistic analysis using parsimony of this genus with RNA sequences of 450 nucleotides of the N gene from 14 new Argentinean isolates and 4 previously described isolates. Representatives of the Bunyaviridae family, Rift Valley Fever Virus (Phlebovirus) and Bunyamwera (Bunyavirus), were used as the outgroup in separate analyses."
"The Onderstepoort journal of veterinary research","Twenty-four species of South African wild animals were tested for the presence of antibodies against the viruses of 16 common diseases of domestic animals. Positive results were obtained for African horsesickness, equine encephalosis, equid herpes virus-1, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis, Allerton disease (Herpes mammillitis), lumpy skin disease, parainfluenza, encephalomyocarditis, bluetongue, Wesselsbron disease, bovine ephemeral fever, and Akabane disease complex. No antibodies could be demonstrated against the viruses of equine influenza, equine infectious anaemia, equine viral arteritis and Rift Valley fever. The negative results substantiate observations that the latter diseases, with the exception of equine viral arteritis, are absent in South Africa. The number of animal species found positive for a specific virus, ranged from 0-16. No antibodies were found in crocodiles and warthogs, whereas antibodies against Wesselsbron and bovid herpes virus-1 were present in 16 species. Antibodies against viruses of horses were found almost exclusively in zebras and, although elephants reacted to African horsesickness, no neutralizing antibodies against it could be demonstrated in their sera. Zebras were also found to be positive for Wesselsbron and Akabane, which are usually regarded as viruses of ruminants. Antibodies against most viruses were encountered in all vegetation zones in South Africa but, as a rule, most viruses were more prevalent in the high-rainfall zone in KwaZulu-Natal."

"Journal of virological methods","An immunoperoxidase monolayer assay (IPMA) was adapted for the detection of antibodies to six arboviruses: three viruses within the flavivirus group (dengue 2, West Nile (WN) and yellow fever) and three in the phlebovirus group (Rift Valley fever (RVF), sandfly fever Naples and sandfly fever Sicilian). Antibody titers of homologous hyper-immune mouse ascitic fluid (HMAF) measured by IPMA were two to eight-fold less than those determined by ELISA. In tests with heterologous HMAF, cross-reactions frequently observed in ELISA, particularly in the flavivirus group, were absent in all IPMA titrations. With human serum samples tested for antibodies to RVF (n = 52) and WN (n = 90), the sensitivity of IPMA as compared with ELISA was 96 and 91%, respectively, specificity of IPMA was 100%. In addition, the IPMA format has several advantages that make it a useful alternative to ELISA for diagnosing arboviral infections under field conditions."

"The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene","In two areas of Senegal where previous evidence of Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus circulation was detected, Barkedji in the Sahelian bioclimatic zone and Kedougou in the Sudano-Guinean zone, a longitudinal study of the enzootic maintenance of RVF virus was undertaken from 1991 to 1993. Mosquitoes, sand flies, and ticks were collected and domestic ungulates were monitored with serologic surveys. Rift Valley fever virus was not isolated in Kedougou. In Barkedji, RVF virus was isolated from Aedes vexans and Ae. ochraceus mosquitoes collected in traps near ground pools and cattle droves and from one health sheep. Sand flies were not involved in the maintenance cycle. Seroconversions were recorded in three (1.9%) of 160 monitored sheep and goats. The interepizootic vectors appeared to belong to the Aedes subgenus Neomelaniconion in East Africa, and to the subgenus Aedimorphus in West Africa. Epizootics in East Africa are associated with an increase in rainfall. However, factors associated with epizootics remain unknown for West Africa."
"Molecular and cellular probes","A reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay to detect Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus RNA in experimentally infected mosquitoes was developed. The specificity of the assay was evaluated with three other phleboviruses; sandfly fever Sicilian (Sabin), sandfly fever Naples (Sabin) and Punta Toro (MSP 3) viruses. The relative sensitivity of the assay, determined by using RVF virus RNA extracted from serial dilutions of virus culture, was approximately 50 plaque forming units. This sensitivity level was 100-fold higher when a nested PCR procedure was used. When the RT-PCR assay was used with coded samples of intrathoracically-infected and uninfected mosquito, the assay detected the virus in all infected mosquitoes. With this assay, it was possible to detect RVF virus RNA in a single infected mosquito in the background of 10, 25 or 50 uninfected mosquitoes."
"Virology","A reconstituted transcription system composed of the Rift Valley fever phlebovirus (Bunyaviridae family) proteins L and N expressed via recombinant vaccinia viruses and an S-like model RNA containing the CAT gene in the antisense orientation, has been described previously by Lopez et al. (J. Virol., 1995, 69, 3972-3979). We extended the use of this in vivo system to determine the sequence at the 3' end of the ambisense S segment recognized by the transcription complex. A mutational analysis of the sequences at the 3' end of the S-like genomic or antigenomic RNA was undertaken. The data indicated that the minimal sequence required for transcription resides in the 13 first 3' nucleotides of the genomic or antigenomic RNA. In these sequences, two regions appeared crucial: the bases at positions 3 to 8 and the purine at position 13. In addition, the terminal repeat ...GU could be deleted without affecting significantly the template activity of the RNA. These data support the prime and realign mechanism proposed recently for Bunya- and Arenaviruses"
"Médecine tropicale : revue du Corps de santé colonial","The term hemorrhagic fever covers a number of diseases with different clinical and epidemiologic features. All these diseases are zoonoses but their occurrence is not confined to tropical areas. Some occur in polar zones. Travelers to endemic areas for these diseases are at risk of infection. There are two modes of transmission. Arthropods are vectors for some diseases such as yellow fever, dengue fever, and Rift Valley fever which are carried by mosquitos and Congo-Crimea virus which is carried by ticks. Airborne contamination by rodent excrement is responsible for transmission of hantaviruses and arenaviruses. Nosocomial infection is a risk for health care providers. Some types of hemorrhagic fever such as Bolivian hemorrhagic fever are highly localized, while other types such as dengue are observed worldwide. Judging from the small number of cases observed in European countries, the overall risk for travelers seems low except unless high-risk activities are planned. The main exceptions are yellow fever and dengue which can easily be transmitted to tourists by mosquitos. Yellow fever can be prevented by vaccination. Typical dengue is usually self-limited but hemorrhagic forms require treatment to prevent shock."
"Médecine tropicale : revue du Corps de santé colonial","The epidemiology of Rift Valley Fever has undergone extensive revision over the last twenty years since the epidemics that occurred in Egypt in 1977 and Mauritania in 1987. From 1931 when the disease was first described until the end of the 70s, Rift Valley Fever was considered to be a relatively benign zoonoses for man that developed in domestic animals (especially sheep) periodically following heavy rainy seasons. The presumptive reservoir for the virus in latent years was an unidentified animal living in the wilderness. However the outbreaks in Egypt and Mauritania and data obtained from ensuing research led to complete reassessment of this assumption. Current data suggest that environmental factors (especially ecological changes caused by development of hydroelectric resources) and low-grade transmission in domestic animals (especially rodents) could account for survival of the virus in zones uninhabited by wild animals and in Sahelian areas."
"The Onderstepoort journal of veterinary research","The distribution of Rift Valley fever (RVF) viral antigen was studied by immunohistochemistry in the liver, spleen, prescapular lymph node, lungs and kidneys ot eight experimentally infected new-born lambs and in four new-born lambs that died of RVF during the 1974-75 RVF epidemic. The eight experimentally infected lambs were euthanazed at 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 33, 48 and 51 h post-infection (p.i.), respectively. Immunohistochemical staining utilized polyclonal hyperimmune mouse ascites fluid to RVF virus and peroxidase-diaminobenzidine was substrate. Virus antigen was most prominent in the liver and was detected as early as 18 h p.i. in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes that were sparsely scattered throughout the lobules. At 24-33 h p.i. antigen was also present in or adjacent to small foci of hepatocellular necrosis. At 48-51 h p.i. and in one of the field cases, positive staining was widespread and most consistently present in the cytoplasm of large numbers of degenerated or necrotic hepatocytes and in a new acidophilic bodies. Immunohistochemical staining was rarely observed in hepatocyte nuclei. Almost diffuse histochemical staining was observed in disintegrated cells and in the cytoplasm of necrotic hepatocytes throughout the liver in the other three field cases with pannecrosis; only the primary foci necrosis and a narrow periportal rim of intact hepatocytes did not stain. No staining was observed in bile duct epithelium, endothelial and Kupffer cells in the initial stages of Infection, supporting the contention that hepatocytes constitute the primary site of RVF virus replication in new-born lambs. Few cells stained positively in the spleen, prescapular lymph node, lungs and kidneys."
"The Journal of general virology","Infection of mammalian cells with Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) leads generally to the production of virus and cell death. In this paper we examined the fate of Vero cells infected with three strains of RVFV and observed that, while a large proportion of cells exhibited a clear cytopathic effect (CPE), a small but significant fraction did not undergo a lytic infection but was able to proliferate and establish a persistent infection. Several independent RVFV persistently infected cell lines have been established and passaged for more than 1 year after infection with a virulent strain (ZH548) and two attenuated strains (C13 and MP12). Although the viruses used for the primary infection were plaque-purified, we do not know whether defective-interfering particles were responsible for the establishment of the persistent infection. The persistently infected cells became resistant to superinfection with RVFV but not with other viruses and shed low amounts of infectious, lytic and non-lytic virus during a limited number of passages. In all the passages tested, the three genomic segments or related products were synthesized as well as the structural nucleoprotein N and glycoproteins G1 and G2. Abnormal defective RNAs were detected, migrating faster or slower than their respective counterparts. The faster-migrating RNAs were internally deleted, some of them possessing only the very terminal part of the 5' genomic end."

"The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene","Certain mosquito species are susceptible to viral infection but cannot transmit the virus due to a salivary gland barrier. We hypothesized that such species could transmit virus if the mosquito were infected with both virus and malaria parasites. Malaria sporozoites disrupt the integrity of mosquito salivary glands and, in so doing, may destroy salivary gland barriers to viral transmission. To examine this postulate, the model system of Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus and a rodent parasite, Plasmodium berghei, in Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes was used. Viral transmission rates for RVF virus-inoculated anophelines that were previously fed either gametocytemic blood (malaria-infected) or normal blood (control) were compared. Viral transmission rates for anophelines having concurrent sporozoite infection of the salivary glands were 32% (n = 25). None of the RVF virus-inoculated control anophelines (n = 55) transmitted virus. These studies confirm an earlier report that malaria sporozoites can disrupt salivary gland barriers and enhance mosquito transmission of arboviruses. Taken together with similar studies using microfilarial parasites, it is increasingly apparent that mosquito-borne parasites have the potential to enhance mosquito transmission of arboviruses."
"Revue scientifique et technique (International Office of Epizootics)","Between 1986 and 1989, 2,255 sera collected from six domestic animal species in Nigeria were tested for antibodies to Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus. In addition, a longitudinal study was carried out from July 1987 to December 1988, using ten sentinel flocks on four farms at Ibadan and Ile-Ife, to determine the activity of RVF virus (RVFV). All samples were tested for haemagglutination-inhibiting antibodies and positive sera were further screened, using the plaque reduction neutralisation test. Of 2,255 samples, 259 (11.5%) had haemagglutination-inhibiting and neutralising antibodies, as follows: sheep (18.7%), goats (10.4%), cattle (10.2%), horses (9.8%) and camels (3.3%). The highest prevalence of RVFV antibody was found in the plateau area (18.4%). Animals aged three years or more had a higher prevalence of antibodies to RVFV. Longitudinal studies showed seroconversion to RVFV in ten of the 210 animals which were kept under observation (4.8%). All seroconversions occurred during the wet season. The results of this study indicate that the infection of animals with RVFV is widespread in Nigeria."
"Revue scientifique et technique (International Office of Epizootics)","Between 1985 and 1989, a total of 3,121 human sera collected from different population groups in six ecological zones of Nigeria were tested for the presence of antibodies to Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus by the haemagglutination-inhibition test. All reactive sera were further tested by the plaque reduction neutralisation test and specific RVF immunoglobulin M (IgM) assay. A total of 461 sera (14.8%) demonstrated haemagglutination-inhibiting antibody and 390 of the 461 initially reactive sera (84.6%) revealed neutralising antibodies. A significantly higher exposure to the virus was found among livestock workers and wildlife rangers than in other categories of people tested. The rate of positive reactions was higher in adults of 30 years or more than in younger age groups. Of 461 sera tested for specific RVF IgM, 107 gave positive results (23.2%). The highest prevalence of RVF IgM was found among livestock and forestry workers. In the longitudinal survey, an RVF virus infection rate of 6.7% was demonstrated. The infection rate was significantly higher during the wet season than during the dry season of the same year."
"The Japanese journal of veterinary research","This review is to provide information on viral diseases of livestock in Zambia. The distribution of the diseases as well as the control measures and limited research that has been done, are described. Foot and mouth disease (FMD) causes serious economic losses in the cattle industry. So far five serotypes (SAT1, SAT2, SAT3, O and At of FMD virus have been isolated in Zambia. Other notifiable viral diseases are rabies, Rift Valley fever, Lumpy skin disease, African horse sickness, bluetongue, African swine fever, Newcastle disease, Marek's disease, fowlpox and infectious bursal disease. Based on the reports of clinical and/or serological diagnoses, these are widespread in the country, although their precise incidence rates are not known. With the establishment of a veterinary school equipped with modern diagnostic facilities and the increasing number of qualified veterinary personnel, this review would stimulate surveillance study on the viral diseases for the ultimate goal of achieving effective disease control measures."

"Chemotherapy","Tragacanthin polysaccharides from Astragalus brachycentrus (AV208) and Astragalus echidnaeformis (AV212) plants, which are devoid of in vitro antiviral activity, were evaluated in a mouse model of Punta Toro virus (PTV) infection. The PTV (a phlebovirus member of the Bunyaviridae family of viruses) is a model for studying the treatment of Rift Valley fever and hantavirus infections. Single intraperitoneal treatments with 12.5-200 mg/kg/day doses of AV212 given 24 h before or 4 and 24 h after virus inoculation protected the majority of mice from mortality. Single treatments with AV208 were ineffective when given 24 h before the virus challenge; however, protection was afforded when treatments were administered at 4 and 24 h following virus inoculation. In a follow-up study, AV208 treatments of 1.6-50 mg/kg/day given 24 h subsequent to virus exposure caused reductions in mortality, liver infection scores, liver and spleen virus titers, and serum transaminases. The polysaccharides did not activate lymphocytes or natural killer cells, nor was interferon induced in treated mice. However, mice pretreated with fumed silica (a macrophage poison) and infected with the PTV were not protected by subsequent administration of AV208 or AV212 at 50 mg/kg, providing evidence that activation of peritoneal macrophages by the polysaccharides affords protection to infected animals. These compounds should be considered for the potential treatment of significant human infections induced by bunyaviruses and hantaviruses."
"The Indian journal of medical research","An emerging viral infection may be a totally new disease with undescribed symptomatology as it was in the case of Kyasanur forest disease in Karnataka, but more often it is an introduction of a known or little known disease in an area where the disease did not occur earlier e.g. yellow fever in Kenya or Rift valley fever in Egypt. The virus may show altered degree of virulence due to many changing factors as in the case of the different haemorrhagic fevers. Many factors may contribute to the emergence of viral infections which may be genetic exchanges or mutations; adaptation to new hosts or vectors; and changed social patterns of humans like urbanization, rapid transport, trade, migration of people or of vectors, strain on civic facilities or changing moral values and life-styles. Large scale changes in ecology due to global warming, deforestation or afforestation, building of dams or canals, changed agricultural practices, rearing of livestock or birds may also contribute to emergence of viral diseases. A number of emergent virus infections relatively important to India have been discussed. To combat emergent virus infections, a comprehensive strategy needs to be evolved. A national viral surveillance system needs to be established. Epidemiology of virus diseases needs to be studied in depth. Development of diagnostic reagents and their supply to investigating centres, a Central serum bank, and a virus respository are important factors. Research and development on viruses, as regards the epidemiology, diagnosis, pathogenesis and vaccinology of virus infections need to be strengthened. An international network of databases of virus infections needs to be instituted. A global network for the diagnosis and containment of emerging viral diseases is advocated."
"Meditsinskaia parazitologiia i parazitarnye bolezni","In 1978-1991 the USSR-Guinea Virological and Microbiological Laboratory functioned in Kindia, the Republic of Guinea. Arbovirus activity in this country was studied by a number of virologists and other specialists. Their personal contribution and achievements in this collaboration are reflected in the present paper. About 74,000 mosquitoes, 100,000 Ixodidae ticks, 1,500 wild birds, 2,700 bats, 106 monkeys, and 308 other mammals, 927 blood samples collected from febrile patients were examined in 1978-1989, using inoculation of new-born white mice. As a result of this work 127 strains of the following arboviruses were isolated: Chikungunia (1 strain), Dengue 2 (4), Saboya (7), Wesselsbron (1), Bunyamwera (4), M'Poko (5), Rift Valley Fever (6), CHF-Congo (9), Dugbe (22), Bhanja (6), Forecariah (2), Jos (26), Abadina (15), Kindia (2), Ark 6956 (1), Fomede (2), Bluetongue (9), Mossuril (2), AnK 6009 (1), and Kolente (2). Dengue 2, Wesselsbron, Bunyamwera, M'Poko, Kindia, Mossuril viruses were isolated from mosquitoes. Ixodidae ticks were sources for isolation of Chikungunia, Saboya, CCHF, Dugbe, Bhanja, Forecaciah, Jos, Abadina, Kindia, Ark 6956, Fomede, Bluetongue, and Kolente viruses. Saboya, RVF, Fomede, Kolente, AnK 6909 were isolated from bats (Chiroptera); Saboya, Abadina, and Bluetongue viruses from birds. One strain of Dugbe virus was originated from the brain of Cercopithecus patas. Bunyamwera and Abadina viruses were isolated from the blood of two febrile patients. Serological identification of many strains was kindly conducted at the Pasteur Institute, Dakar (J. P.Digoutte) and some at the YARU, USA (R. Shope). Kindia and Ark 6956 (Reovirus, gr. Palyam), Fomede (gr. Chobar Gorge), Forecariah (Bunyavirus, gr. Bhanja), Kolente (Rhabdovirus) were identified as an original type of Lagos bat virus. The results of seroepidemiological surveys are also presented."
"The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene","Reintroduction of Rift Valley fever (RVF) into Egypt in 1993 raised concerns about the potential for Egyptian mosquitoes to transmit the virus. We evaluated the ability of Aedes caspius, Culex pipiens, Cx. antennatus, Cx. perexiguus, Cx. poicilipes, and Anopheles pharoensis collected in the Aswan area and Cx. pipiens collected in the Nile Delta to transmit RVF virus. All mosquito species tested were susceptible to RVF virus infection, with An. pharoensis and Ae. caspius being the most sensitive to infection. However, none of 12 An. pharoensis, including 10 with a disseminated infection, transmitted RVF virus by bite. In contrast, nearly all Cx. pipiens (87%, n = 15) and Cx. perexiguus (90%, n = 10) with a disseminated infection transmitted virus. Overall transmission rates for mosquitoes exposed to hamsters with a viremia > or = 10(7) plaque-forming units/ml were Ae. caspius, 20% (n = 5); Cx. pipiens, 7% (n = 102); Cx. antennatus, 7% (n = 30); Cx. perexiguus, 11% (n = 9); and An. pharoensis, 0% (n = 7). Based on abundance, susceptibility to infection, ability to transmit virus, and feeding behavior, Ae. caspius appeared to be the most efficient vector of the Egyptian mosquitoes evaluated. While less susceptible than Ae. caspius, Cx. pipiens, Cx. antennatus, and Cx. perexiguus were also potential vectors during this RVF outbreak in Egypt."
"Journal of virology","Viruses of the Bunyaviridae family cause a variety of diseases ranging from uncomplicated fever to potentially lethal encephalitis and hemorrhagic fever. Little is known about the factors determining pathogenicity in the vertebrate host. Interferons have been reported to be inhibitory, but their mode of action against members of the Bunyaviridae has not yet been elucidated. The interferon-induced MxA protein encoded on human chromosome 21 is a large GTPase with antiviral activity against distinct negative-strand RNA viruses, notably influenza viruses. Here we show that MxA inhibits representative members of the Bunyaviridae family by interacting with an early step of virus replication. When constitutively expressed in stably transfected Vero cells, MxA prevented the accumulation of viral transcripts and proteins of Hantaan virus (genus Hantavirus). Other members of the family such as La Crosse virus (genus Bunyavirus) and Rift Valley fever virus and sandfly fever virus (both genus Phlebovirus) were likewise inhibited, and virus titers were reduced up to 10(4)-fold. Our data indicate that humans have evolved a mechanism of controlling these viruses irrespective of differences in viral coding strategies."

"Revue d'élevage et de médecine vétérinaire des pays tropicaux","Experimental infection of three indigenous breeds of sheep in Nigeria, namely the West African Dwarf (WAD), Yankasa and Ouda resulted in fatal disease with the Zinga Rift Valley Fever virus. Infected sheep of the three breeds responded by pyrexia within 24 h of infection, that lasted 6 to 7 days, but peaked between day 2 and 4 post-infection. Viraemia coincided with pyrexia and peaked (10(9) PFU/ml) 3 days p.i. in Yankasa and WAD sheep, but with highest titre (10(7.5) PFU/ml) in Ouda sheep. Zinga Rift Valley Fever virus infection of sheep was characterised by hyperactivity, watery and mucoid nasal discharges, projectiles and bloody diarrhoea, external haemorrhage and clinical manifestations of nervous disorders. Viraemia was followed by low level of antibody development in all the infected sheep. Haemotological changes included a sharp fall in the PCV, Hb concentration and total RBC count during the course of the disease. These changes were most severe in the Yankasa, followed by WAD and Ouda breeds. There were thrombocytopaenia, prolongation of prothrombin and clotting times in all the infected sheep. There was also progressive leucopaenia associated with lymphopaenia. The total protein and albumin levels were depressed, but the globulin level rose from day 5 p.i. The changes in the serum biochemical constituents included sharp and progressive increase in the level of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase. The sodium level decreased gradually while that of potassium was initially stable but later increased until the infected animals died. There was a significant increase in the level of blood urea nitrogen from day 3 p.i. that continued until the infected animals died. Gross and microscopic examinations of the carcasses of the infected sheep showed significant lesions in many organs, including disseminated intravascular coagulation."
"Archives of virology. Supplementum","Travel is a potent force in the emergence of virus infections. Migration of humans and animals has been the pathway for disseminating virus diseases throughout history. In recent years, dengue virus has been identified as the most important travel-related, vector-borne virus disease. Other vector-borne virus infections, such as sandfly fever, Rift Valley fever, chikungunya fever and Japanese encephalitis, have been diagnosed in travelers returning from endemic areas. Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever may not only be imported by infected live stock, but also by travelers. Of rodent-borne virus infections, Lassa fever has been diagnosed occasionally in travelers returning from endemic areas. The potential impact of imported filoviruses is currently discussed."
"Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene","Sequential blood samples taken from 237 adult and 147 young Zebu cattle in the Central African Republic (CAR) were examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the presence of antibodies to Rift Valley Fever (RVF), Dugbe (DUG), Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF), Chikungunya (CHIK) and Wesselsbron (WSL) viruses. Antibodies to DUG and CCHF viruses were detected in 70% and 61% respectively, of the sera from adult cattle, probably due to common antigens. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that CCHF virus was isolated only 3 times from ticks, whereas DUG virus was isolated from almost all ticks. Ticks of the genus Hyalorama, the most important vectors of CCHF, are rare on Zebus in CAR. CCHF virus has a limited role in local human pathology, probably because its distribution is limited by the scarcity of its main vector and the immunological barrier resulting from the presence of antibodies to DUG virus. Antibodies to RVF virus were found in about 8% of adult cattle. Zebus do not play an important role in the spread of CHIK and WSL viruses among humans; these viruses were found in only one and 5, respectively, of the 183 cattle examined."
"Bulletin of the World Health Organization","In the early summer of 1993, an outbreak of Rift Valley fever (RVF) was reported among both humans and animals in Aswan Governorate, Upper Egypt. To determine whether RVF infection had spread to the Nile delta region of the country, we carried out a cross-sectional survey of 1181 occupationally exposed abattoir workers (97% male; age 10-72 years) in 15 governorates of Egypt in November 1993. The overall prevalence of anti-RVF virus IgM antibody was 2% (range: 0% (7 governorates) to 10%). The highest prevalences were in Ismailia (10%) and Sharqîya (8%) Governorates. None of the seropositive subjects reported having experienced an episode of fever in the 2 months prior to the study. The prevalence of antibody was significantly higher (P < 0.05) among workers employed in high-risk jobs such as cutting animals' throats (relative risk (RR = 2.24)) and handling animal parts (RR = 2.37). The findings suggest that abattoir workers represent a useful sentinel population for surveillance of RVF."
"The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene","Beginning in August 1990, approximately 800,000 coalition troops were deployed to the Persian Gulf during Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. There was substantial concern about arthropod-borne diseases, particularly sand fly fever and cutaneous leishmaniasis, because of high morbidity rates in the Persian Gulf during World War II (WWII). In sharp contrast to WWII, there was no report of sand fly fever among coalition forces and only 31 cases of leishmaniasis among 697,000 U.S. troops. To further evaluate the risk of arthropod-borne diseases, an entomologic survey was conducted in 12 areas of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. A total of 1,556 arthropods was collected during four survey periods in 1992. The suspected vectors of cutaneous Leishmania major infection, sand fly fever, West Nile fever, Rift Valley fever, and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever were identified; however, there was no evidence of arboviruses or Leishmania among collected specimens nor from 51 trapped rodents. There are several possible reasons for the low risk of arthropod-borne infectious diseases among Desert Shield/Storm troops in an area where suspected vectors frequently were found: the use of insecticides and repellents, and the deployment of most ground troops to the open desert during the cooler, winter period--conditions least favorable for the transmission of arthropod-borne diseases."
"East African medical journal","Yellow fever (YF) is a well known disease that had plagued the tropics relentlessly until an effective vaccine was developed. Although the yellow fever vaccine is relatively affordable and one dose protects for over ten years, its use has predominantly been for known endemic areas of the world and international travellers. Eastern and southern African states, have hitherto been free of epidemic yellow fever, hence routine YF vaccination is not a policy in these countries. The sudden emergence of YF in the Rift Valley in Kenya in 1992-1993, introduces new dimensions into the challenges of YF to eastern and southern African states. Isolation of a virus deemed to be native of the area is discussed in this article in the context of YF policy issues confronting the region. A case has been argued for the establishment of a network of active surveillance systems in the region backed by adequate laboratory YF expertise locally, regionally, and internationally."

"Parassitologia","Aedes albopictus, a mosquito of Asian origin, has been rapidly spreading in all the continents since a decade: it is now established in North and South America, Africa, Oceania and even in Europe where it was detected in Albania, 1979 and in Italy, 1990. The international shipping trade of used tires provides to Ae. albopictus an ideal mechanism of dissemination, and everywhere the tire stocks constitute an extremely productive ecological niche. Now, this mosquito is present in several localities in Northern and Central Italy, and it is a real threat for other Mediterranean countries, particularly Southern part of France (French Riviera and Corsica) where climatic conditions are very suitable for its establishment. In addition, the tolerance exhibited by some natural populations of Ae. albopictus for low temperatures allows this species to occupy an area much further north than Ae. aegypti. Ae. albopictus is a very competent vector for many arboviruses, particularly the four dengue serotypes, with the possibility of a vertical transmission; we also know that it can act as an experimental vector for many other viruses. The consequences of its introduction into France would lie in an increased level of transmission of autochthonous viral or filarial (canine dirofilariasis) infections, along with the spread of viruses presently unknown in the region (like dengue, Rift Valley fever, Batai, etc.). For these reasons, it is necessary to set up a permanent entomological surveillance in all the threatened areas in order to detect immediately such an introduction and to be able to quickly eliminate the mosquito."
"The Onderstepoort journal of veterinary research","A sucrose-acetone-extracted, Madin-Darby-bovine-kidney (MDBK)-derived Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) antigen was tested both in an indirect ELISA and a haemagglutination-inhibition test for its ability to detect serum antibodies to RVFV. Optimal conditions for antigen concentration, serum and conjugate dilutions for the ELISA were established by checkerboard titration. The specificity and sensitivity of ELISA were determined by the use of paired pre- and post-vaccination sheep-serum samples. Compared with the virus neutralization test, the overall ELISA specificity and sensitivity were 97.4 and 97.3%, respectively. There was a 100% correlation between the results obtained in haemagglutination-inhibition tests with a RVFV sucrose-acetone-extracted antigen derived from hamster liver, and from MDBK cells. A total of 10 582 field-serum samples (84 cattle, 3,659 sheep, 6,839 goats) collected in 1994-1995 from animals of unknown vaccination status in different regions of South Africa were tested with ELISA for antibodies against RVFV. There were no seropositive cattle, 0.16% seropositive sheep and 0.12% seropositive goats.

"Australian veterinary journal","The proposal by the Zoological Parks Board of New South Wales to import 10 southern black rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis) from Zimbabwe as part of an international project for conservation of the species presented the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) with a unique challenge. This importation is, at least in the modern era, the first importation of live herbivores from the African continent. Many of the serious animal diseases in the world are endemic in parts of Africa. Knowledge of which of these diseases infect wild species and may be transmitted from the wild species to domesticated species, is limited. This paper describes the strategies adopted by AQIS to facilitate the importation of rhinoceros while maintaining protection of Australian consumers, rural industries, domestic livestock and fauna against the entry and spread of unwanted pests and diseases."
"International journal of epidemiology","From Africa, our knowledge on how malnutrition and diseases influence the ability to work is limited. In a one-year population-based study, we investigated the effects of nutritional status, illness and socioeconomic factors on the activity pattern in a rural population in southern Ethiopia.From July 1991 to June 1992, 226 people (109 men and 117 women) from the Elka na Mataramofa village in the Rift Valley were examined every 3 months. Information on the occurrence of illness and measurement of nutritional status were collected every 3 months. At the same time we interviewed each person for seven consecutive days to assess the pattern of activities.Men and women had a mean estimated energy expenditure (SD) of 2937 kcal (951) and 1977 (513) kcal, respectively. The mean body mass index (BMI) (SD) was 19.7 (2.3) for men and 20.0 (2.6) for women. Men showed a significant seasonal variation in estimated energy expenditure that was highest during the pre-harvest time. Women did not show such a seasonal variation. In a multivariate analysis, sex, age, state of nutrition, period prevalence and severity of diseases and seasonality influenced estimated energy expenditures.Both low BMI and illness are significantly associated with low estimated energy expenditure. Most likely, this represents an example of the vicious circle of malnutrition, disease and activity that affects subsistence farming communities. Development work that improves the state of nutrition and health of the adult population may therefore enhance the work performance of rural populations."
"The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene","The 74HB59 strain of Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus, isolated from a human case in the Central African Republic, was shown to be composed of a heterogeneous population of viruses when plaque-purified clones were analyzed for their reactivity with monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) directed against the nucleocapsid (N) protein or the nonstructural (NSs) protein. One of these clones, C13, was of particular interest in that it proved to be avirulent in mice and hamsters, and highly immunogenic. Although C13 showed normal reactivity with a large panel of MAbs directed at the glycoproteins, it failed to react with specific MAbs or polyclonal antibodies directed at the NSs protein and with a specific MAb recognizing the N protein of the Egyptian strains. Consequently, the small RNA segment, which encodes the N and NSs proteins in an ambisense strategy, was sequenced and compared with the existing sequence of the attenuated MP-12 RVF virus strain. We found that the NSs gene contained, in addition to two conservative coding changes, a large internal deletion of 549 nucleotides that removes 69% of the open reading frame but conserves in-frame the N and C termini of the predicted translation product. In addition, the sequence revealed that the N protein of C13 contained a single amino acid change. Clone C13 replicated normally in certain cell types in vitro and in Culex pipiens mosquitoes after intrathoracic inoculation, but established abortive infections in MRC-5 human fibroblasts."
"The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene","In this paper, we consider the movement of Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus from infected mosquito midgut epithelial cells into the hemocoel as an important factor in the ultimate ability of the insect to transmit the virus. Our results are therefore significant in the context of vector competence. The mosquito Culex pipiens was identified as the primary vector of RVF in an epidemic that occurred in Egypt in the 1970s. On this basis, we have carried out several studies of RVF virus in this mosquito species. In the research reported here, we used immunocytochemical and transmission electron microscopic techniques to study the occurrence of RVF virus in the mosquito cardia and aspects of the histology and ultrastructure of this organ. The cardia is a complex organ consisting of both foregut and midgut tissue and is the location of the foregut-midgut junction. The cardia is of interest because it appears to provide routes of RVF virus egress from the midgut lumen and it is consistently infected in mosquitoes with disseminated infections, making it a potentially important site of viral amplification and an ideal site for studying RVF viral morphogenesis. In orally infected mosquitoes, large numbers of RVF virions were observed budding into the basal labyrinth associated with the outer cardial epithelial cells and into the noncellular matrix associated with the inner cardial epithelial cells and the cells of the intussuscepted foregut. In mosquitoes infected by injection of virus into the hemocoel and then held for different incubation periods, viral antigen was first detected in the cells of the intussuscepted foregut in the cardia and later in the cardial epithelial cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene","A repository of domestic animal sera collected in Niger between 1984 and 1988 was assayed for antibody against two zoonotic hemorrhagic fever viruses known to be present in the West African Sahel. A total of 2,540 serum samples from 2,324 cattle, sheep, goats, and camels were tested by an IgG-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the 80% plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT80) for Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus antibody. Of the 2,540 sera tested for RVF-specific IgG antibody, 1,676 sera from cattle, sheep, and goats were examined for RVF-specific IgM antibody by ELISA. A subset of 2,263 sera were examined for evidence of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus antibody by an IgG-specific ELISA. Antibody against CCHF virus was found to be most prevalent in adult cattle (422 of 732 or 57.7% positive) sampled at nine locations in the Niamey area. The highest prevalence for RVF neutralizing antibodies was found in camels from the Agadez Department with 67 (47.5%) of 141 positive. The results indicate that both CCHF and RVF viruses are circulating in Niger and are potential zoonotic health risks."
"Journal of medical entomology","Host-selection patterns of mosquitoes were determined over a 1-yr period at Abu Heif, a village in Sharqiya Governorate, Egypt, that has had a history of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) transmission. Culex pipiens L. and Cx. antennatus Becker were the most common mosquito species collected, and 8,252 blood meals from both species were analyzed by a precipitin technique. Host availability was estimated by a monthly census of human and animal populations. Both mosquito species exhibited opportunistic endophagic behavior. In bedrooms, 79% of Cx. pipiens fed on humans, compared with 53% of the Cx. antennatus. In animal sheds, 35% of Cx. pipiens and 68% of Cx. antennatus fed on sheep or goats. Cx. pipiens was primarily anthropophilic (forage ratio = 2.7) whereas Cx. antennatus was mainly an ovine feeder (forage ratio = 2.4). These findings indicated that both species probably were involved in the transmission of RVFV in Sharqiya Governorate during the epidemics of 1977 and 1978, Cx. pipiens being mainly responsible for transmission to humans, and Cx. antennatus for transmission among domestic animals. The persistent custom of keeping sheep and goats inside human dwellings, combined with the opportunistic host selection by the local mosquitoes, continues to make this area receptive to RVFV transmission."
"Antiviral research","Modulation of the immune response by the chloroform-methanol residue (CMR) of phase I Coxiella burnetii whole cell was studied in Rift Valley fever virus-infected, or in naive endotoxin-non-responder C3H/HeJ mice. A single dose of CMR completely protected the mice from viral infection. Treating virus-infected mice with antibodies directed against interferons alpha/beta (IFN-alpha beta) and gamma (IFN-gamma) eliminated the CMR-induced protection. CMR stimulated the production of high levels of IFN-alpha/beta and 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase activities in sera of the CMR-treated mice. IFN-gamma was present in supernatants of cultured spleen cells of CMR-treated, virus-infected mice, but not in their serum. Priming mice with CMR optimized the release of INF-gamma, interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha) and IL-6 from splenocytes in vitro. When stimulated in vitro, IL-2 and granulocyte-macrophage stimulating factor (GM-CSF) did not require in vivo priming for release from cultured spleen cells. Fluorescence-assisted cytometry of CMR-treated mouse spleen cells showed there was a CMR-dependent increase in the percentage of T-cells and Ia-positive T-cells. There also was a biphasic increase in the ratio between Th (L3T4) and Ts (Lyt2) cells. Biological activities stimulated by CMR indicate that CMR is a potent immunostimulant, which may modulate specific and non-specific antiviral responses."
"Journal of virology","Overlapping cDNAs representing the complete L segment of Rift Valley fever virus were assembled, and the L protein was expressed via a recombinant vaccinia virus. The transcriptase activity of the L protein was assayed with two types of templates: natural ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) and artificial genome-like RNAs. RNPs purified in a CsCl gradient did not retain the RNA polymerase function, but the activity was restored when the L cDNA was expressed in mammalian cells via a recombinant vaccinia virus. Indeed, after transfection of transcriptase-depleted RNPs in cells infected with the recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the L protein, the mRNAs coding for the N and NSs proteins and to a lesser extent, those coding for the glycoproteins were synthesized as well as the corresponding proteins. The transcriptase activity of the recombinant L protein was then investigated by using synthetic templates containing the reporter chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene in the antisense orientation flanked by the 3' and 5' noncoding region of the S genomic segment. Our results indicate that after transfection of the RNA templates, transcription was achieved in cells coexpressing both the L and N proteins. Together, the experiments demonstrate that the two proteins N and L are absolutely required and sufficient to reconstitute the transcriptase activity."

"Antiviral research","Strains of Coxiella burnetii phase I and II whole cells (WC-I and WC-II) or whole cell fractions were assessed for their potential to induce long-lasting protection in endotoxin-non-responder C3H/HeJ or CD-1 mice against Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus challenge. Among the whole cell fractions, only the chloroform-methanol residue (CMR), administered as a single dose (100 micrograms per mouse) 24 h before viral challenge, effectively protected 100% of the mice from RVF virus; the CMR of the Ohio strain of C. burnetii was not protective. Most of the RVF virus-infected mice treated with other C. burnetii cell fractions died, although their times to death varied. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) associated with CMR preparations used in these studies, did not protect against RVF virus challenge. A single dose of 100 micrograms of CMR given 24 h before viral challenge completely eradicated 4-5 logs of RVF virus in the serum, liver, spleen, and central nervous system. Compared to several other immunomodulators, CMR was an equally effective antiviral agent. Efficacy of CMR of both Henzerling and Ohio strains disappeared or was marginal when treatment was initiated 2-3 days before RVF viral challenge, even when a second or a third dose of CMR was administered after challenge. A single dose of liposome-encapsulated CMR to RVF virus-infected mice extended the range of therapeutic efficacy of this biologically active component of C. burnetii to 4 days before infection."

Culicoides spp. (family Ceratopogonidae) transmit the arboviruses of bluetongue (BT), African horse sickness (AHS), bovine ephemeral fever (BEF) and Akabane. Some other arboviruses have been isolated from these species, while fowl pox has been transmitted experimentally by Culicoides. These insects are vectors of the parasitic protozoans Leucocytozoon caulleryi and Haemoproteus nettionis, and the parasitic nematodes Onchocerca gutturosa, O. gibsoni and O. cervicalis. They also cause recurrent summer hypersensitivity in horses, ponies, donkeys, cattle and sheep. Farm animals can die as a result of mass attack by Simulium spp., which are also vectors of Leucocytozoon simondi, L. smithi and the filariae O. gutturosa, O. linealis and O. ochengi. Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis (VEE) and Rift Valley fever (RVF) have been isolated from simuliids, and vesicular stomatitis virus New Jersey strain has been replicated in Simulium vittatum. Simuliids are well known as vectors of O. volvulus, the cause of human onchocercosis (river blindness). The family Psychodidae includes the genera Phlebotomus and Lutzomyia (subfamily Phlebotominae), vectors of Leishmania spp. in humans, dogs and other mammals. Vesicular stomatitis virus Indiana strain has been regularly isolated from phlebotomine sandflies. Mass attack by mosquitoes can also prove fatal to farm animals. Mosquitoes are vectors of the viruses of Akabane, BEF, RVF, Japanese encephalitis, VEE, western equine encephalomyelitis, eastern equine encephalomyelitis and west Nile meningoencephalitis, secondary vectors of AHS and suspected vectors of Israel turkey meningoencephalitis. The viruses of hog cholera, fowl pox and reticuloendotheliosis, the rickettsiae Eperythrozoon ovis and E. suis, and the bacterium Borrelia anserina are mechanically transmitted by mosquitoes. These insects also induce allergic dermatitis in horses. They transmit several filarial worms of both animals and humans, and are of great medical importance as vectors of major human diseases, including malaria, yellow fever, dengue fever and many more diseases caused by arboviruses."
"Antiviral research","A major component of a US Army Medical Research and Development Command-supported program to discover and develop new drugs for the treatment of Rift Valley fever, sandfly fever, and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever has been to study candidate test materials against hepatotropic infections of C57BL/6 mice induced by the related but less biohazardous Punta Toro virus (PTV). The effects of 75 compounds, some of which were considered immunomodulators in their primary mechanism of activity, were studied in the PTV infection model. Of these, ribavirin, ribamidine, ribavirin 2',3',5'-triacetate, tiazofurin, tiazofurin-5'-monophosphate, tiazofurin-2',3',5'-triacetate, selenazofurin, pyrazofurin, 3-deazaguanine, and 3-deazaguanosine were considered significantly inhibitory, acting against the infection by a direct antiviral (non-immunomodulatory) fashion. These compounds had therapeutic indices (TI) ranging from > or = 5 to 65, using increased survivors as the evaluation parameter. Immunomodulators considered significantly inhibitory to this infection were poly (ICLC), ampligen, human recombinant interferon-alpha-A/D, MVE-1, MVE-2, AM-3, AM-5, mannozym, bropirimine, CL246,738, phenyleneamine, and 7-thia-8-oxoguanosine. Utilizing increased survivor numbers as measure of activity, these inhibitors had TI ranging from > or = 16 to 1000. Other antiviral effects exerted by the active compounds included reduction of hepatic icterus, lowered serum glutamic oxaloacetic and pyruvic acid transaminases, and inhibition of recoverable serum and liver virus titers. The active immunomodulators were significantly effective when therapy was initiated as late as 48 h after virus inoculation, at a time when clinical signs of the PTV disease were being manifested in the animal."

In August 1993, serologic surveys were conducted in two villages to estimate the prevalence of RVF virus (RVFV) antibody among persons residing in selected rural communities in Aswan Governorate. This report summarizes the findings of these serosurveys and two nested epidemiologic studies conducted in the same villages 2 weeks later."

"The Journal of tropical medicine and hygiene","An outbreak of acute febrile illness occurred during August and September 1989 in the Northern Province of Sudan coinciding with a high population density of phlebotomine sandflies. An investigation was conducted to determine whether arboviruses were associated with human illness during this outbreak. Sera were obtained from 185 febrile individuals and tested for IgG and IgM antibody to selected arboviruses by enzyme immunoassay (EIA). The prevalence of IgG antibody was 59% for West Nile (WN), 53% for Sandfly Fever Sicilian (SFS), 32% for Sandfly Fever Naples (SFN), 39% for Yellow Fever (YF), 24% for dengue-2 (DEN-2), 23% for Rift Valley Fever (RVF), 12% for Chikungunya (CHIK) and 5% for Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) viruses. Antibody prevalences tended to increase with age for WN and YF viruses. Antibody rates were about the same for males and females for most of the viruses tested. The prevalence of IgM antibody to SFN was 24% and reciprocal IgM titre exceeded 12,800 for some individuals suggesting that this virus was the cause of recent infection. The prevalence of IgM antibody for the other viruses did not exceed 5%. The study indicated that several arboviruses were endemic and some of them may have caused human disease in the Northern Province of Sudan."
"The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene","To investigate past infection in and transmission of Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus to humans within an endemic focus, we undertook a retrospective cohort study of the seminomadic Peul people living in sub-Saharan northcentral Senegal. Residents of the rural settlement of Yonofere five years of age or older were studied during February-May 1989. Anti-RVF virus IgG was found in blood samples of 22.3% of 273 persons who responded to a standard questionnaire; none had IgM antibodies. Seropositivity was similar for males (25.4%) and females (21.1%), increased markedly with age for both sexes, and varied considerably among compounds (groups of huts) (0-37.5%). Risk factors for past RVF virus infection were nursing sick people, assisting animals during abortions/births, and treating sick animals. In all age groups, odds ratios (ORs) for RVF viral antibody among females who reported treating sick animals were three to six times greater than for those who did not. The ORs for males who reported assisting with animal births/abortions and nursing sick people were approximately five times those for males who did not. Serologic prevalence of RVF viral antibody among sheep averaged 30.1% overall (0.8% IgM), but varied among compounds (0-66.7%) in a manner different from that of humans. The seasonal abundance and relative density of potential mosquito vectors were estimated by monthly samples captured in Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-type traps. Mosquito abundance varied seasonally with rainfall (> 90% captures during four months). Species diversity was large (28 spp.), dominated by Aedes and Culex. Rift Valley fever virus was not isolated from 142 pools of 2,956 unengorged mosquitoes tested, although three other arboviruses were found. Results indicate that RVF is endemic in this region, people are at considerable risk of infection, and that a heretofore unrecognized mode of human infection under nonepizootic conditions may be transmission via contact with infected animals or humans."
"The Journal of general virology","The sequence of Rift Valley fever virus L segment that we published in a previous paper was erroneous in the 3'-terminal region of the antigenomic RNA molecule. Here, we have shown that the L segment is in fact 6404 nucleotides long and encodes a polypeptide of 237.7K in the viral complementary sense. Sequence comparisons performed between the RNA-dependent RNA polymerases of 22 negative-stranded RNA viruses revealed the existence of two novel regions located at the amino termini of the proteins and conserved only in the polymerases of bunya- and arenaviruses. In the region conserved in all RNA-dependent polymerases, corresponding to the so-called 'polymerase module', we identified a new motif, designated premotif A, common to all RNA-dependent polymerases, as well as amino acids located in the region between motifs preA and A which are strictly conserved for segmented negative-stranded RNA viruses. Using the recently released coordinates of human immunodeficiency virus reverse transcriptase and the alignment between all RNA-dependent polymerases in the 'polymerase module', we have determined the position of the conserved residues in these polymerases and discuss their possible functions in light of the available structural information."
"The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene","For the first time in West Africa, arboviruses were isolated from phlebotomine sand fly pools. One strain of Chandipura virus (a Vesiculovirus), four strains of Saboya virus (a Flavivirus), and one strain of a not yet identified virus were isolated. Three hundred twenty-two pools were established from a population of 33,917 sand flies caught in CO2 light traps in the Ferlo Sahelian region of Senegal from November 1991 to December 1992. This is the first isolation of Chandipura virus from any arthropod in Africa. Saboya virus has already been isolated from small rodents in Senegal; thus, its transmission cycle probably involves rodentophilic sand flies. No strain of Rift Valley fever phlebovirus, which caused an epizootic in this region in 1987, was isolated. During the same time at the same site, 11 sand fly species were identified from 4,191 specimens caught on sticky traps, including Phlebotomus duboscqi, a leishmaniasis vector."
"The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene","The ability of adult Anopheles stephensi to transmit Rift Valley fever virus was determined for mosquitoes inoculated at selected times during development. None of 109 female An. stephensi inoculated as adults transmitted virus to hamsters. In contrast, 83% (50 of 60) of those inoculated as larvae transmitted virus by bite to hamsters. Transmission rates decreased as the stage of the mosquito at the time of inoculation changed from larva to pupa to adult. Transmission rates for adult mosquitoes inoculated as larvae, as pupae < 4 hr after pupation, as pupae > 24 hr after pupation, or as adults were 83%, 25%, 11%, and 0%, respectively. Viral titers recovered from mosquitoes were similar for all groups tested, regardless of stage at infection (larva, pupa, or adult) or of transmission status (transmitter or nontransmitter). Thus, differences in transmission rates may have been due to site-specific (i.e., salivary gland) replication, rather than a generalized increase in viral replication in mosquitoes inoculated at an earlier age."

"Voprosy virusologii","The prophylactic and therapeutic effects of ADP-ribosylation inhibitors, 3,N-acetylaminobenzamide and 3,N-butyrylaminobenzamide, were studied in mice inoculated with an alphavirus or a bunyavirus. Both drugs were shown to have high levels of antiviral activity when given as a single subcutaneous injection in a dose of 10 mg/kg while increasing the number of injections did not increase their efficacy or might even decrease it."
"Bulletin de la Société de pathologie exotique (1990)","A domestic ruminants serosurvey of Rift valley fever (RVF) neutralizing antibodies has been carried out during three years after the 1987 epidemic in the Senegal River Basin. Authors present results from the 1990 serosurvey that are matched with the preview surveys. Out of 1,225 ongulate tested, 17.2% had RVF virus antibodies. There is a global decrease in the herds immunity since the epizootic manifestation associated with the 1987 epidemic. Significant differences in seroprevalence are observed from the delta (28.5%) to the lower (17.9%) and middle valley (6.1%) of the Senegal river. Cattle are more likely to be with an higher seroprevalence than goat and sheep."
"Research in virology","Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) were used to examine possible stages at which antibody-mediated neutralization of Rift Valley fever virus occurs, and to assess whether binding of antibody is dependent on viral protein structure in order that antibody recognition take place. Analysis of the structural properties of the antigenic determinants revealed that the neutralizing sites are highly conformation-dependent. None of the mAb prevented virus binding, suggesting that the epitopes they define are spatially separate from the site(s) responsible for virus attachment to the cellular receptor. The finding that many of the mAb also did not inhibit virus entry into the cell demonstrated that neutralization of RVFV infectivity by immune antibodies is not dependent on blocking at the early stages in the viral life cycle."
"The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene","Studies were conducted to determine the effect of environmental temperature on the susceptibility of Aedes taeniorhynchus mosquitoes for Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) and Rift Valley fever (RVF) viruses. Mosquitoes reared at low temperature (19 degrees C) were significantly more susceptible to infection with RVF virus (infection rate = 70%, 158 of 226) than were those mosquitoes reared at 26 degrees C (infection rate = 48%, 135 of 280), regardless of the temperature at which mosquitoes were held after exposure to virus (19 or 26 degrees C). Likewise, for Ae. taeniorhynchus exposed to VEE virus, the infection rate in mosquitoes reared at low temperature (97%, 236 of 243) was significantly greater than was that for mosquitoes reared at 26 degrees C (78%, 217 of 280), regardless of the temperature at which mosquitoes were held after exposure to virus (19 or 26 degrees C). Conversely, in mosquitoes infected with either RVF or VEE virus, virus disseminated from the midgut to the hemocoel more rapidly in mosquitoes held at 26 degrees C than in those held at 19 degrees C, regardless of the rearing temperature. Thus, a combination of low larval-rearing temperature and warm adult-holding temperature resulted in the most efficient mosquito transmission of both viruses."
"Lancet","Rift Valley fever (RVF) has been recorded in man and in domestic animals in Egypt after a 12-year absence. Human infections were first noted in the Aswan Governorate in late May, 1993. Only cases of ocular disease, an infrequent and late manifestation, were reported. Of 41 cases, 35 were tested serologically and 27 (77%) had RVF virus-specific IgM antibodies. An estimated 600-1500 infections occurred in the region. Abortions in cattle and buffalo were seen concurrently and antibodies to RVFV were present in 39% of domestic livestock, presumably unvaccinated. RVFV was isolated from an aborted water buffalo fetus."

"Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene","Seroepidemiological surveys were conducted to determine the frequency and distribution of haemorrhagic fever virus (HFV) activity in the Central African Republic. Human serum specimens (4295) were collected from 5 ecologically distinct zones. Serological evidence of HFV activity was found in all the zones. The filovirus antibody prevalence (24.4%, 1051/4295) was greater than the combined prevalence for Lassa virus, Rift Valley fever virus and Crimean-Congo HFV antibody (1.1%, 45/4295; P < 0.01). Evidence of filovirus activity was found in all zones: 21.3% (914/4295) of the population were seropositive for Ebola virus antibody while only 3.2% (137/4295) were seroreactive with Marburg viral antigens. Age and sex were important host-related factors influencing filovirus activity, particularly in dry grassland and moist forest communities. These communities shared many factors, but differences, such as agricultural practices and ethnic backgrounds, may also affect the risk of infection. Filovirus infections appear to occur without apparent disease. Continued investigations are needed to evaluate the true pathogenicity of the African filoviruses and the likelihood that unidentified serologically cross-reacting and non-pathogenic members of the filovirus family are active in equatorial Africa."
"Antiviral research","Viruses causing hemorrhagic fevers in man belong to the following virus groups: togavirus (Chikungunya), flavivirus (dengue, yellow fever, Kyasanur Forest disease, Omsk hemorrhagic fever), arenavirus (Argentinian hemorrhagic fever, Bolivian hemorrhagic fever, Lassa fever), filovirus (Ebola, Marburg), phlebovirus (Rift Valley fever), nairovirus (Crimian-Congo hemorrhagic fever) and hantavirus (hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, nephropathic epidemia). Hemorrhagic fever virus infections can be approached by different therapeutic strategies: (i) vaccination; (ii) administration of high-titered antibodies; and (iii) treatment with antiviral drugs. Depending on the molecular target of their interaction, antiviral agents could be classified as follows: IMP dehydrogenase inhibitors (i.e., ribavirin and its derivatives); OMP decarboxylase inhibitors (i.e., pyrazofurin); CTP synthetase inhibitors (i.e., cyclopentylcytosine and cyclopentenylcytosine); SAH hydrolase inhibitors (i.e., neplanocin A); polyanionic substances (i.e., sulfated polymers); interferon and immunomodulators."
"The Medical journal of Australia","Viral zoonoses cause overt disease in humans and other animals or silent infections in animals and overt disease in unnatural hosts such as humans. Often the virus and its animal host have evolved together and learned to live together. Infection may spread freely between the natural host animals and cause no signs of disease, but this balance may be upset by many factors, including stress, changing environmental conditions and mutations in both viruses and hosts. Infection of an unnatural host may cause clinical disease but no further spread of the virus. Examples of viral zoonoses both old and new are used to illustrate some of these points, and two will be described in detail--Rift Valley fever and influenza."
"The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene","To determine the current prevalence of antibody to arboviruses, rickettsiae, and hantaan-like viruses, a survey was carried out in the Nile River Valley of Egypt, one of the principal foci of the 1977-1978 Rift Valley fever (RVF) outbreak. Blood specimens were obtained from 915 persons representing 190 study households. Enzyme immunoassay testing showed that the overall prevalence of IgG antibody was 4% to sand fly fever Sicilian (SFS), 2% to sandfly fever Naples (SFN), 15% to RVF, 20% to West Nile, and 4% to Hantaan (HTN) viruses. Antibody was demonstrated among 32% of the same study subjects to Coxiella burnetii, 58% to Rickettsia typhi, and 32% to R. conorii. The prevalence of agent-specific antibody tended to increase with age. Particularly notable was the low prevalence of RVF infection in children born after the height of the RVF outbreak. No detectable antibodies were found in the population less than seven years of age and in only 3% of those 7-12 years old. In contrast, 26% of the study population 13-19 years old, who were young children and infants at the time of the outbreak, were found to have RVF antibodies, suggesting that the level of intensity associated with transmission decreased considerably following the documented 1977-1978 outbreak. Geometric mean titers (GMT) ranged from 139 for C. burnetii to 1,305 for RVF, and did not vary significantly by age, except for high titers for RVF in the 20-49-year-old age group. A significant upward trend in GMT was also noted when antibody was detected in the specimen for more than one phlebovirus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"Journal of the American Mosquito Control Association","The effect of controlled burning on the survival of Aedes mosquito eggs was evaluated in 2 distinct dambo habitats. In a dambo dominated by grasses, egg survival was 3.3% after burning compared with 43.8% in a similar dambo that was not burned. In a dambo dominated by sedges, egg survival was 0.7% after burning compared with 28.5% in a similar dambo that was not burned. Mortality of mosquito eggs appeared to be caused by high temperatures associated with the fire and not elapsed time since egg survival did not decrease with time after burning. The potential for burning to control the mosquito vectors of Rift Valley fever virus is discussed."
"Survey of ophthalmology","Viruses are one of the most common causes of infections involving the posterior segment of the eye. Such infections can occur either on a congenital or an acquired basis, and may affect primarily the retina or the choroid. Congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) and rubella infections may result in retinitis. CMV retinitis is also the most common cause of acquired viral retinitis, primarily because of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Other types of viral retinitis, such as those caused by herpes simplex or herpes zoster, can occur in immunocompromised or immunocompetent individuals. Retinitis or choroiditis caused by viruses such as measles, influenza, Epstein-Barr virus, and Rift Valley fever virus, typically occurs subsequent to an acute viral systemic illness. The systemic and ocular manifestations, as well as the histopathology, laboratory tests, differential diagnoses, and treatment regimens for each of the individual viruses are discussed in detail."
"The Veterinary clinics of North America. Food animal practice","The ability of certain viruses to affect prenatal development in domestic animals is well documented. However, differentiating a viral-induced malformation from those caused by genetic or other environmental causes is a diagnostic dilemma. Understanding how viruses interact with their embryo-fetal hosts and the potential consequences on prenatal development requires refining and dispelling some old concepts and injecting new insights into this diagnostic challenge. This article discusses several viral teratogens affecting domestic animals: Akabane, bluetongue, Cache Valley, Japanese B encephalitis, bovine viral diarrhea, Border disease, Chuzan, epizootic hemorrhagic disease, hog cholera, Rift Valley fever, and Wesselsbron disease viruses."

"Virus research","The complete nucleotide sequence of Toscana (TOS) virus (Bunyaviridae, Phlebovirus) L segment was determined. The L segment is 6404 nucleotides long, containing a single open reading frame (ORF) in the viral complementary sense coding for a protein of 2095 amino acids that, as in the case of negative strand RNA viruses, could be part of the RNA polymerase of TOS virus. This ORF is expressed by a messenger RNA (mRNA) as long as the genomic segment. Like the mRNAs expressed by the genomic segments of the other Bunyaviruses, the L mRNA has non-templated sequences at the 5' end. The comparison of TOS L protein sequence with the corresponding sequences of other negative strand RNA viruses showed a very high homology only with the Rift Valley Fever (RVF) virus. The residues conserved between the two proteins are mainly concentrated in the central region and contain three DD motifs proposed by Argos (1988) to be functional domains of DNA and RNA polymerases. The complete sequence of the Toscana virus L genomic segment has been deposited in the EMBL library with the accession number X68414."
"Preparative biochemistry","Zone electrophoresis (ZE) in concentration gradients of sucrose proved to be a powerful technique in the purification of viruses although it is seldomly used as a single step for the separation of the infective agent from extraneous matter but usually as a final procedure. No difficulties were experienced in the purification of plant viruses with ZE possibly because of the resistance of the agents to the chloroform butanol treatment which the impure plant viruses received prior to the ZE. Likewise no difficulties were encountered during purification of human and animal picorna viruses because they also are resistant to chloroform or chloroform-butanol treatment prior to ZE. Purification of animal and possibly human reoviridae ZE as a final step is involved as they are associated with or even attached to the host cell membranes which are lipoidal in nature. Because the lipoidal material on the virus has an affinity for organic solvents the virus particles are caught in the emulsion when an extract of the crude virus material is shaken with the organic solvent. With these viruses polyethylene glycol M(r) 6000 (PEG) is often helpful as a means of displacing most of the host proteins as a step in the partial purification prior to ZE. Neurotropic African horse sickness virus which presented many problems to overcome was rendered free of extraneous proteins to the extent that electron micrographs could be made of it. Neurotropic Rift Valley fever virus was similarly difficult to purify as it was always associated with mouse brain components. This virus was finally purified from infected mouse blood in which the virus particles were not associated with host cell debris and other extraneous proteins. Zone electrophoresis experiments were not conducted on viruses with large particle sizes e.g. myxoviruses because they could be purified without a great deal of effort using polymer displacement, and thin layer centrifugation. Zone electrophoresis as a means of final purification was vividly displayed with the purification of five viruses of the larvae of the pine emperor moth, Nudaurelia cytheria cytheria."
"Bulletin de la Société de pathologie exotique (1990)","A study about the circulation of arboviruses of medical interest in southeastern Senegal was conducted from 1988 to 1991, during and around the periods of transmission. Specific IgM antibodies were detected by ELISA test in human sera, as a sign of a recent infection within 2 to 5 months. The comparison of the serological IgM results from human surveys in different villages, and the isolations of arboviruses from mosquitoes during the same period of time permitted a rapid and global evaluation of the circulation of these viruses. A low level of yellow fever virus activity was detected both in humans and mosquitoes in 1988 to 1990. A dengue 2 epizootic occurred in 1989-1990. Dengue 2 virus was isolated from humans and mosquitoes in 1990. Some dengue 2 outbreak may occur in the upcoming years. A Zika virus epizootic outbreak was observed each year. A human strain was isolated in 1990. The other flaviviruses (West-Nile, Kedougou, Wesselsbron), Chikungunya virus, Rift Valley Fever virus and Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever virus did not seem to present a major public health concern in southeastern Senegal."
"Voprosy virusologii","A relationship between ribamydil concentration and the intensity of accumulation of peroxidation products was found while storing ribamydil-containing liposomes which indicated a significant pro-oxidant activity of ribamydil. Increasing lethality of guinea pigs and white mice infected with Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis virus was shown while using liposomal ribamydil containing from 4.78 to 6.82 nmol. ml-1 malonic dialdehyde which appeared to be associated with disordered function of the antioxidant system of the experimental animals."
"The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene","During August and September 1988, we collected adult mosquitoes from 14 locations in the Senegal River basin to search for evidence of Rift Valley fever (RVF) viral activity one year after the 1987 outbreak, which occurred along the Senegal-Mauritania border. More than 62,000 specimens representing 18 species in seven genera were collected with carbon dioxide-baited, solid-state Army miniature light traps and sheep-baited traps. Twenty virus isolations from Culex, Aedes, and Anopheles mosquitoes were recovered from six locations: Fanaye Diery (11), Bode (four), Matam (two), Diongui (one), Ndialene (one), and Ngoui (one). Species yielding viral isolates were Anopheles pharoensis (eight), Culex tritaeniorhynchus (three), Cx. univitattus gr. (three), Cx. antennatus (two), Cx. poicillipes (two), Ae. hirsutus (one), and An. gambiae (one). Viruses were identified by complement fixation, and virus and plaque-reduction neutralization testing as Ngari (Bunyavirus, Bunyaviridae) (n = 15), Babanki (Alphavirus, Togaviridae) (n = 3), Bagaza (Flavivirus, Flaviviridae) (n = 1), and Bangui (Bunyavirus-like) (n = 1). No evidence of any RVF viral activity in the Senegal River Basin was detected in the mosquitoes tested."
"Veterinary pathology","Three calves (Nos. 1, 2 = 7 days old; No. 3 = 21 days old) were inoculated subcutaneously with virulent Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus. All calves became viremic and clinically ill, but the two 7-day-old calves were moribund and were euthanatized subsequently on post-inoculation day (PID) 3. Highest viral titers were measured in the serum, with lesser concentrations in the brain, heart, spleen, and liver of these animals. Viral antigens were detected by immunohistochemical analysis only in the livers, where positive staining was localized in coalescing foci of hepatocellular necrosis. The 21-day-old calf appeared to recover after viremia and pyrexia but became lethargic and ataxic and was euthanatized on PID 9. The calf was no longer viremic, and RVF virus was isolated only from the brain. Microscopic examination of the central nervous system revealed diffuse perivascular infiltrates of lymphocytes and macrophages, multifocal meningitis, and focal areas of neuronal necrosis and aggregates of macrophages, lymphocytes, and neutrophils throughout all regions of the brain and cervical spinal cord. There was positive immunohistochemical staining for viral antigens within the cytoplasm of neurons and glial cells throughout the central nervous system. Thus, RVF virus can cause encephalomyelitis in calves, and the specific virologic diagnosis can be made by immunohistochemical localization of viral antigens in formalin-fixed tissues."
"Virology","The 5' and 3' ends of N and NSs mRNAs, transcribed from the S segment of Toscana Phlebovirus, were analyzed by oligonucleotide primer extension and S1 nuclease mapping procedures. The results showed that both mRNAs acquired, at their 5' end, approximately 9-15 nucleotides not present in the viral template, suggesting an initiation transcription mechanism similar to the one described for influenza virus. Furthermore, the 3' ends of the two mRNAs were located in a sequence motif conserved in the S segment of two other Phleboviruses, the Rift Valley Fever and Sandfly Fever Sicilian viruses. This finding suggests the possible involvement of this sequence in the mechanism of transcription termination."
"Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene","A serosurvey was conducted during October and November 1989 to estimate the prevalence of selected arboviral, rickettsial, and Hantaan viral antibody among a sample of schoolchildren from 4 villages in the Bilbeis area of the Nile river delta, Egypt. Blood specimens were obtained from subjects aged 8 to 14 years. Enzyme immunoassay testing of the sera indicated that the prevalence of antibody was 9% (21/223) for Sicilian sandfly fever, 4% (8/223) for Rift Valley fever, 3% (15/437) for West Nile virus and 9% (28/315) for Hantaan (HTN) virus. Antibody was demonstrated among 22% (93/418) of the same study subjects against Coxiella burnetti, 53% (199/373) against Rickettsia typhi, and 37% (137/371) against R. conorii."
"Journal of natural products","A series of 23 Amaryllidaceae isoquinoline alkaloids and related synthetic analogues were isolated or synthesized and subsequently evaluated in cell culture against the RNA-containing flaviviruses (Japanese encephalitis, yellow fever, and dengue viruses), bunyaviruses (Punta Toro, sandfly fever, and Rift Valley fever viruses), alphavirus (Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis virus), lentivirus (human immunodeficiency virus-type 1) and the DNA-containing vaccinia virus. Narciclasine [1], lycoricidine [2], pancratistatin [4], 7-deoxypancratistatin [5], and acetates 6-8, isonarciclasine [13a], cis-dihydronarciclasine [14a], trans-dihydronarciclasine [15a], their 7-deoxy analogues 13b-15b, lycorines 16 and 17, and pretazettine [18] exhibited consistent in vitro activity against all three flaviviruses and against the bunyaviruses, Punta Toro and Rift Valley fever virus. Activity against sandfly fever virus was only observed with 7-deoxy analogues. In most cases, however, selectivity of the active compounds was low, with toxicity in uninfected cells (TC50) occurring at concentrations within 10-fold that of the viral inhibitory concentrations (IC50). No activity was observed against human immunodeficiency virus-type 1, Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis virus, or vaccinia viruses. Pancratistatin [4] and its 7-deoxy analogue 5 were evaluated in two murine Japanese encephalitis mouse models (differing in viral dose challenge, among other factors). In two experiments (low LD50 viral challenge, variant I), prophylactic administration of 4 at 4 and 6 mg/kg/day (2% EtOH/saline, sc, once daily for 7 days, day -1 to +5) increased survival of Japanese-encephalitis-virus-infected mice to 100% and 90%, respectively. In the same model, prophylactic administration of 5 at 40 mg/kg/day in hydroxypropylcellulose (sc, once daily for 7 days, day -1 to +5) increased survival of Japanese-encephalitis-virus-infected mice to 80%. In a second variant (high LD50 viral challenge), administration of 4 at 6 mg/kg/day (ip, twice daily for 9 days, day -1 to +7) resulted in a 50% survival rate. In all cases, there was no survival in the diluent-treated control mice. Thus, 4 and 5 demonstrated activity in mice infected with Japanese encephalitis virus but only at near toxic concentrations. To our knowledge, however, this represents a rare demonstration of chemotherapeutic efficacy (by a substance other than an interferon inducer) in a Japanese-encephalitis-virus-infected mouse model."
"Research in virology","Between February and April 1991, unusual numbers of bovine abortion around Antananarivo (central highlands, Madagascar) were reported by official veterinary services. Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus isolations were made from sixteen aborted foetuses and one dead calf in different foci. Using monoclonal antibodies, the isolated viruses were found to be different from the 1979 RVF strains isolated in Madagascar from mosquitoes and human laboratory infection, and closer to African RVF strains. In a bovine population--previously characterized by a negative or very low RVF antibody prevalence--a high prevalence of IgM antibodies (264/994: 26.5% positive) was revealed; the IgM prevalence in recently aborting females varied from 40 to 91%. Among 994 human sera tested by IgG-IFA (immunofluorescent antibody assay) and IgM ELISA, 8.2% and 4.5%, respectively, proved positive. A total of 11,371 mosquitoes (61% Culex antennatus) were collected in the epizootic areas and tested without any virus isolation. Extensive studies were conducted to determine the geographical extension and the impact of this epidemic on the highly susceptible livestock and human populations."
"Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene","Within the Phlebovirus serogroup, Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus is endemo-enzootic in the African sahelian zone. Recently an RVF epizootic in West Africa prompted a serosurvey in the major sheep and cattle raising areas. Because of the close antigenic relationship between the phleboviruses it appeared of interest to evaluate the prevalence of the other phleboviruses also. In 1987, 482 sheep serum samples were collected in 2 different ecological zones of Burkina Faso and tested for the presence of phlebovirus antibodies. A sensitive but non-specific immunofluorescent antibody test and a specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used, with the following African phlebovirus antigens: Rift Valley fever (RVF), Arumowot, Gabek Forest, Gordil, Saint Floris and Odrenisrou. A total of 15.8% of the sera sampled had anti-RVF antibody in the ELISA. RVF virus appeared to be more active in drier areas such as the sahelian region, known to be an enzootic area for the disease. Antibodies to other phleboviruses were found in 11.8% of the samples, independent of RVF virus activity. It is assumed that sheep can be infected by different phleboviruses."

"Biopolymers","The peptide YKGTMDSG (Tyr-Lys-Gly-Thr-Met-Asp-Ser-Gly) represents an important antigenic determinant from the glycoprotein G2 of the pathogenic Rift Valley fever virus. By preparing a series of single-residue substitution peptides, the importance to antigenicity of individual residues within this octapeptide has been determined. Here, we investigated a simple and rapid computational analysis to test for correlations between the observed antigenicity of the substitution analogue peptides and the calculated conformational preferences in local regions of the peptides. Conformational energy analyses were carried out on all dipeptide combinations represented in the wild-type octapeptide and in the single-residue substitution analogue peptides. Conformational similarities and differences between wild-type and substitution dipeptide pairs were determined. The results of these computational analyses were then compared with the data on the relative antigenicity of the wild-type octapeptide and the substitution analogues. This comparison revealed a positive correlation. Substitution peptides showing changes in antigenicity possessed significant changes in the calculated backbone conformation relative to wild type in the dipeptides encompassing the residue substitution. Substitution peptides showing no change in antigenicity similarly showed no significant changes in dipeptide conformation. The potential utility of dipeptide conformational energy analyses and this preliminary structure-activity correlation are discussed."
"Journal of medical entomology","The effect of inoculation of mosquito larvae with Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus on survival to the adult stage was evaluated in Aedes aegypti (L.), Ae. fowleri (Charmoy), Ae. mcintoshi Huang, Ae. taeniorhynchus (Wiedemann), Ae. triseriatus (Say), Eretmapodites quinquevittatus Theobald, Anopheles albimanus Wiedemann, and Culex pipiens L. Pupation rates were similar for RVF virus-inoculated and diluent-inoculated larvae of all mosquito species tested except Cx. pipiens. However, with the exception of An. albimanus and Ae. triseriatus, virtually all pupae derived from RVF virus-inoculated larvae failed to emerge successfully as adults. In contrast, both pupation and emergence rates were similar for diluent-inoculated and either La Crosse or St. Louis encephalitis virus-inoculated larvae of Ae. taeniorhynchus. There was also poor survival to the adult stage of Ae. taeniorhynchus inoculated with either eastern equine encephalomyelitis (EEE) or chikungunya (CHIK) virus. The high mortality rates observed under laboratory conditions of pupae derived from larvae inoculated with either RVF, EEE, or CHIK virus may be responsible for the lack of laboratory confirmation of vertical transmission of these viruses."
"The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene","To determine whether virus-transmitting mosquitoes inoculate infectious particles extravascularly or directly into the vascular system, we permitted mosquitoes infected with Rift Valley fever virus to feed on the distal third of the tails of suckling mice. Amputation of the distal half of the tail within 5 min after their being bitten significantly increased mouse survival as compared with that of mice whose tails remained intact. Even when tails were amputated 10 or more min after mosquito feeding, the median time to death was significantly longer in the group with the amputated tails (53.5 hr) than in those mice with intact tails (46.0 hr). Mouse survival did not correlate with ingestion of blood by the infecting mosquito. We conclude that mosquitoes inoculate virus extravascularly, rather than directly into the vascular system, when feeding on a vertebrate host. Such extravascular delivery of virus by a transmitting mosquito may affect viral pathogenesis, antiviral activity, and vaccine efficacy."
"The Journal of general virology","The complete nucleotide sequence of the L RNA segment of Uukuniemi virus has been determined from cloned cDNA. The L RNA is 6423 nucleotides in length, and is of negative polarity. The viral-complementary RNA contains a single large open reading frame of 2104 codons which corresponds to the L protein (M(r) 241039). Comparison with the L protein sequences of other members of the Bunyaviridae showed homology with the Rift Valley fever phlebovirus L protein (38% amino acid identity), but no detectable similarity with bunyavirus, hantavirus or tospovirus L proteins. These data lend further support for the recent reclassification of uukuviruses and phleboviruses into the same genus, Phlebovirus, in the family Bunyaviridae. The L RNA sequence completes the determination of the Uukuniemi virus genome: since the M RNA segment is 3229 and the S RNA segment 1720 nucleotides, the whole genome comprises 11372 nucleotides."
"The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene","Primer-extension sequencing of the RNA template of polio, dengue, Rift Valley fever, and Japanese encephalitis (JE) viruses has provided new information on their geographic distribution, origin, and evolution. In a previous study of 46 diverse JE virus strains, we demonstrated the existence of three distinct JE genotypes in Asia. We now report the occurrence of a fourth genotype. In the present study, 19 JE virus isolates, representing various geographic regions of Asia and a 50-year time span, were compared with each other and with Murray Valley encephalitis, West Nile, and Kunjin viruses. Twelve of the JE strains from the Indonesian Archipelago and the Philippines had not been previously examined; the remainder were representatives of the three previously identified genotypes. Two hundred forty nucleotides from the pre-M gene region of the virus were used in these comparisons. Using 12% divergence as a cut-off point, the 19 JE strains fell into four distinct genotypic groups; maximum divergence across the comparison region was 21%. The newly recognized fourth genotype was comprised of five Indonesian isolates that were 7% divergent from the rest of the JE viruses."

"Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences","Rift Valley fever (RVFV) is a major phlebovirus-induced epizootic disease of domestic animals (primarily cattle and sheep) in Africa. No therapies for the disease are known. A related phlebovirus, Punta Toro virus (PTV), has been adapted to induce an RVFV-like disease in C57BL/6 mice. This PTV infection has been used as a model for RVFV because it is reasonably safe and does not require high-level biologic containment. The infection model has been used to study the potential role of immunomodulating substances as therapies. A spectrum of immunomodulators has been studied; those immunomodulators most capable of preventing death and other disease manifestations are ampligen, bropirimine, poly (ICLC), AM-3, P-136, and 7-thia-8-oxoguanosine. An immunologic parameter common to all these substances has been their ability to induce interferon. Timing studies have indicated that these active substances may be administered therapeutically as well as prophylactically to inhibit markedly the progress of the disease. Further work is needed in the development of these materials for use in treating viral infections in domestic animals. As a next step, studies need to be run to compare the immunologic profiles induced by each substance in domestic animals and in mice."
"Research in veterinary science","A live attenuated mutant of Rift Valley fever virus, MV P12, was previously shown to be non-pathogenic in young lambs, but capable of producing protective immunity. The studies reported here show that the abortion in sheep caused by an infection with virulent virus is the result of necrosis of the maternal villi and cotyledons arising from an acute inflammation of the maternal caruncles. Pregnant ewes infected with the attenuated mutant virus MV P12 showed none of these lesions in the placenta and gave birth to healthy lambs. Colostrum from ewes infected with MV P12 virus was able to induce protective immunity in the offspring. These data along with previously published results suggest that the mutant virus MV P12 is an excellent candidate for use as a live attenuated veterinary vaccine."

Results of this study are in agreement with earlier reports that Zinga virus is a strain of Rift Valley fever virus."

"The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene","The dissemination of Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus in females of the epidemic vector Culex pipiens was studied immunocytochemically. Among orally infected specimens, viral antigen was detected in all major midgut regions, although individuals varied with respect to which regions were infected. Among specimens with disseminated infections (infections beyond the midgut epithelium), antigen was detected in most tissues, including those of the nervous and endocrine systems. However, no antigen was found in the ovarian follicular epithelia, oocytes/nurse cells, or female accessory gland. A viral dissemination index (DI) based on several tissues was determined for each orally infected specimen and used to estimate the extent of viral dissemination in the hemocoel. Plots of DI values as a function of time after ingestion of an infectious blood meal indicated that dissemination was sporadic, and that once virus escapes from the midgut, its spread to other tissues is rapid. The most common sequence of tissue/organ infection following escape of virus from the midgut epithelium appears to be as follows: intussuscepted foregut, fat body, salivary glands and thoracic ganglia, epidermis, and ommatidia of the compound eyes. Reduced fecundity and survival identified in other studies of RVF virus-infected Cx. pipiens are probably explainable on the basis of extensive tissue and organ infection resulting in an overall energy drain. Infection of regulatory tissues and organs such as the ganglia of the central nervous system, neurosecretory cells, and the corpora allata may also have detrimental effects on the overall functioning of a mosquito, even in the absence of widespread infection."

"Journal of the American Mosquito Control Association","We studied the effects of various oils used to trap sand flies on the recovery of virus from infected adult Phlebotomus papatasi. Both Rift Valley fever and sandfly fever Sicilian viruses were readily recovered from virus-inoculated specimens held at 26 degrees C on mineral, olive or castor oil-soaked sheets for up to 12 h. However, after 50 h on oil-soaked paper, significantly greater titers were recovered from sand flies trapped with mineral oil than from sand flies trapped with either of the other oils. This indicates that sand flies trapped on oil-soaked paper would be suitable for virus isolation attempts and that mineral oil had the least effect on virus recovery."
"Epidemiology and infection","An hypothesis that there was an annual emergence of Rift Valley fever virus in Zambia, during or after the seasonal rains, was examined with the aid of sentinel cattle. Serum samples taken during 1974 and 1978 showed evidence of epizootic Rift Valley fever in Zambia, with more than 80% positive. A sentinel herd exposed from 1982 to 1986 showed that some Rift Valley fever occurred each year. This was usually at a low level, with 3-8% of the susceptible cattle seroconverting. In 1985-6 more than 20% of the animals seroconverted, and this greater activity was associated with vegetational changes--which could be detected by remote-sensing satellite imagery--which have also been associated with greater virus activity in Kenya."
"Archives of virology","A panel of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) mapping to different antigenic sites on the RVFV G1 and G2 proteins were used to examine the mechanisms involved in neutralization of the virus. Three types of synergistic neutralization of RVFV were observed on mixing various pairs of MAbs. Firstly, enhanced neutralization occurred for two MAb pairs that showed augmented binding for G2. These comprised a combination of a neutralizing MAb with a non-neutralizing antibody, as well as two antibodies which were non-neutralizing individually. In the second category, synergistic neutralization was observed between combinations of MAbs for which increased binding had not been detected. Lastly, mixtures of G1 and G2-specific MAbs were also capable of enhancing neutralization. Post-adsorption neutralization assays revealed that some MAbs neutralized cell-attached virus efficiently, indicating that they can neutralize by inhibiting the infection process after virus attachment. MAbs mapping to G1 IIe, G2I b and G2I c were unable to neutralize adsorbed virus and thus probably neutralize by preventing virus attachment to cells. Several G1-reactive MAbs displayed low level post-adsorption activity, suggesting they may be capable of inhibiting RVFV infectivity at different stages of the replication cycle."

"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","Random insertion mutagenesis has been used to construct infectious Sindbis virus structural protein chimeras containing a neutralization epitope from a heterologous virus, Rift Valley fever virus. Insertion sites, permissive for recovery of chimeric viruses with growth properties similar to the parental virus, were found in the virion E2 glycoprotein and the secreted E3 glycoprotein. For the E2 chimeras, the epitope was expressed on the virion surface and stimulated a partially protective immune response to Rift Valley fever virus infection in vivo. Besides providing a possible approach for developing live attenuated vaccine viruses, insertion of peptide ligands into virion surface proteins may ultimately allow targeting of virus infection to specific cell types."
"Revue d'élevage et de médecine vétérinaire des pays tropicaux","A serological survey of Rift Valley fever was carried out in sheep in Côte-d'Ivoire. Thousand and fifty one seras collected between 1988 and 1990 in the South of the country were tested for IgG and IgM by ELISA with two objectives: determining the incidence of the Rift Valley fever and analysing the role of this virus in reproductive failure and abortion. The incidence rate was 6.85%. No difference was found between the three different geographic areas nor between the three years of the survey. Antibody prevalence increased significantly with age. The Rift Valley fever must be considered as enzootic in Côte-d'Ivoire. A significant relationship was found between positivity and abortion in ewes. Thus, the economic impact of Rift Valley fever has to be studied. The presence of antibodies in young animals aged from 6 months to 1 year, showed a recent activity of the virus; a permanent epidemio-surveillance of the Rift Valley fever in Côte-d'Ivoire is needed, because of the potential risk for human population in contact with the animals."
"Revue d'élevage et de médecine vétérinaire des pays tropicaux","Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus was detected for the first time in Madagascar in 1979, but without any impact on human and animal populations. However, in 1990 and 1991, several outbreaks with massive cattle abortions were described. Since that period, seroepidemiological surveys have been conducted on the East coast and in the highlands (outbreak areas), in the high cattle density regions, and in the national slaughter house in Antananarivo. A high RVF IgM antibody prevalence was detected in the outbreak areas during the epizootics. This IgM prevalence thereafter decreased and was followed by an IgG high prevalence in all tested regions. Hypotheses on the occurrence of the virus in Madagascar, outbreak origins and virus circulation on the island are discussed."
"Journal of the American Mosquito Control Association","Several groups of Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus-exposed and unexposed Culex pipiens were allowed differential access to a carbohydrate food source and their survival monitored. When stressed by deprivation of a carbohydrate source, mean survival times of RVF virus-exposed mosquitoes were consistently higher than those of unexposed mosquitoes in each of the carbohydrate-deficient experiments. These differences were statistically significant when mosquitoes were provided 5% sucrose for 24 hours. Mosquitoes that were provided access to a carbohydrate source for 24 h after a bloodmeal and then were denied access survived significantly longer than did those mosquitoes denied access, regardless of their exposure to RVF virus. When not stressed, RVF virus-exposed individuals had slightly higher daily survival rates than did unexposed individuals."

"Research in virology","In March 1990, a Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) outbreak was suspected in the district of Fenerive on the east coast of Madagascar after an abnormally high incidence of abortions and disease in livestock. Sera from humans and cattle were tested for RVFV antibodies by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and ELISA-IgM capture. Sera and mosquitoes collected in the same area were tested for virus isolation by tissue culture and suckling mouse intracerebral inoculation, and for antigen detection by an ELISA antigen capture assay. Among cattle from the area, RVFV antibody prevalence was 58.6% by IFA and 29.6% by ELISA-IgM. In contrast, human populations in the same area had a lower RVFV antibody prevalence, with 8.01% IFA and 5.4% IgM-positive sera. No RVFV antigen was detected and virus isolation was unsuccessful from the sera and mosquito pools tested. Different hypotheses concerning the emergence and diffusion of RVFV in this area and the occurrence of the outbreak are discussed."
"Vaccine","The formalin-inactivated Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) vaccine, TSI-GSD-200, was administered subcutaneously to highly susceptible adult Wistar-Furth rats (LD50-1 p.f.u., ZH501 strain). Vaccine was administered on days 0, 7 and 28, the same time course used for at-risk personnel. Six months postimmunization, when the serum plaque-reduction neutralization titre (PRNT)80 had declined to low or undetectable levels, rats were challenged with 4.4 log10 p.f.u. of the virulent ZH501 strain in a nose-only dynamic aerosol apparatus. Ninety-seven per cent (33/34) of the non-vaccinated control rats died. In contrast, only 32% (33/105) of the vaccinated animals died. In vaccinated rats that succumbed, there was a doubling of the mean time to death and the cause of death shifted from hepatitis to encephalitis. Rats with a PRNT80 of greater than or equal to 1:40 were protected from clinical disease and histological evidence of hepatic or encephalitic lesions. While the precise mechanisms of immunity against aerosol challenge remain unresolved, here the serum PRNT titre correlated with protection."

After infection, treated monkeys showed no evidence of clinical disease; some had no detectable viremia; when viremia was observed, peak virus titers were decreased compared to control infected monkeys; and only minor and transient perturbations in hematologic and clinical chemistry values were seen. Untreated infected control monkeys developed high-titered viremia, mild to severe clinical disease, and moderate to severe changes in hemostatic parameters and clinical laboratory measurements. No evidence of synergism was noted when RVF virus-infected monkeys were treated prophylactically with combined low doses of rHuIFN-gamma and rHuIFN-alpha A."
"The Journal of biological chemistry","One of the major physiologic functions of erythrocytes is the mediation of chloride-bicarbonate exchange in the transport of carbon dioxide from the tissues to the lungs. The anion exchange is mediated by a typical polytopic transmembrane protein in the cell membrane, designated Band 3. A carboxyl-terminal peptide of Band 3 was affinity-labeled with pyridoxal phosphate, a substrate for the anion transport system, and then sequenced (Kawano, Y., Okubo, K., Tokunaga, F., Miyata, T., Iwanaga, S., and Hamasaki, N. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 8232-8238). The 10th amino acid residue of the peptide could not be determined, suggesting post-translational modification of the residue. In the present communication, we have investigated the molecular structure of human Band 3 and the COOH-terminal 8500-dalton peptide using gas-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Band 3 was modified covalently by fatty acids and these acids were released from Band 3 by hydroxylamine treatment at either pH 7 or 11, indicating that the linkage between Band 3 and the fatty acid is a thio ester bond. 1 mol of Band 3 interacted with 1 mol of fatty acid at a cysteine residue located 69 residues from the COOH terminus of Band 3. The fatty acids used in the modification were myristate, palmitate, oleate, and stearate, with palmitate being the major component. The esterified site is close to the site affinity-labeled with pyridoxal phosphate (Kawano, Y., Okubo, K., Tokunaga, F., Miyata, T., Iwanaga, S., and Hamasaki, N. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 8232-8238). The amino acid sequence including the acylation site was Phe-Thr-Gly-Ile-Gln-Ile-Ile-Cys-Leu-Ala-Val-Leu, which is conserved in the G2 protein of Rift Valley fever virus as Phe-Ser-Ser-Ile-Ala-Ile-Ile-Cys-Leu-Ala-Val-Leu. The G2 protein, like Band 3, is a polytopic transmembrane protein. Although acylation of the cysteine residue of G2 protein has not been examined, the Phe-X-X-Ile-X-Ile-Ile-Cys-Leu-Ala-Val-Leu sequence could be a common motif for fatty acylation of certain membrane proteins."

"The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene","A congenic rat strain (WF.LEW) was derived from the susceptible Wistar-Furth (WF) (background strain) and the resistant LEW (donor strain) inbred strains and was used to evaluate the phenotypic expression of a dominant Mendelian gene that confers resistance to fatal hepatic disease caused by the ZH501 strain of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV). Resistance to hepatic disease developed gradually with age, with full expression at approximately 10 weeks in the WF.LEW and LEW rat strains. The ZH501 strain caused fatal hepatitis in WF rats regardless of age. However, resistance to the SA75 RVFV strain (relatively non-pathogenic for adult rats), was age- and dose-dependent in both WF and LEW rats. The resistance gene transferred to the newly derived WF.LEW congenic rat strain appears to amplify age-dependent resistance of adult rats, resulting in protection against fatal hepatic disease caused by the virulent ZH501 strain. The congenic rat strain will be a valuable asset in elucidating the mechanism of resistance to Rift Valley fever virus governed by the dominant Mendelian gene."

Mosquitoes also became infected with and transmitted the RVF MP12 strain after ingesting virus from a blood-soaked cotton pledget. However, because of the low viremias produced in infected animals, it is unlikely that mosquitoes would become infected by feeding on an animal inoculated with either of these viruses. Although both strains were transmitted by mosquitoes after intrathoracic inoculation, there was no evidence of reversion to a virulent virus."

"Virology","The sequences and coding strategies of the S RNAs of two viruses, Toscana (TOS) and the M12 derivative of Rift Valley fever ZH-548 (RVF, Phlebovirus genus, Bunyaviridae) have been determined from cDNA clones and compared to the previously published sequences of Punta Toro (PT), Sandfly fever Sicilian (SFS), and Uukuniemi (UUK) viruses. All five viruses exhibit an ambisense coding strategy for their small (S) RNA species, i.e., one gene product (the NSs protein) is encoded in the 5' half of the viral RNA, a second (the N protein) is encoded in the sequence complementary to the 3' half. The terminal nucleotides of the S RNAs of the five viruses are comparable through 13-14 residues. The 3' and 5' ends of these S RNAs have inverted complementary compositions. Three phleboviruses (TOS, SFS, and RVFV) exhibit comparable G-rich, centrally located intergenic sequences, albeit of different lengths. These sequences have a number of similar motifs at, or immediately following, the end of the coding regions, motifs that may be involved in their S mRNA transcription termination processes. The other two viruses (UUK, PT) have AT-rich intergenic sequences that have the potential to form secondary structure. They lack the G-rich sequences or particular sequence motifs recognized in the other three virus RNAs. The deduced sizes of the TOS and RVFV N proteins are 27,704 and 27,430 kDa (respectively). Their NSS proteins are 36,677 and 29,903 kDa (respectively). When aligned, the deduced sequences of the N proteins of the five viruses exhibit homologies ranging from 54 to 30%. The order of homology to RVFV N protein is PT greater than TOS greater than SFS greater than UUK; to TOS N protein it is PT greater than or equal to RVF greater than SFS greater than UUK. The sequences of the NSS proteins are less similar, with values ranging from 30 to less than 17%. The order of homology to RVFV NSS is SFS greater than PT greater than TOS greater than UUK. Due to these more distant relationships, the homologies to TOS NSS protein are less clear."

In 1988, 24.4% of the sera was found to have anti-RVF neutralizing antibodies and in 1989, 19.3% was found. In 1988, we observed in the Dagana district, including the 1987 epizootic area, a significantly higher prevalence (71.1%) than in the two other more distant districts of Podor (21.5%) and Matam (9.7%). From 1988 to 1989, the antibody seroprevalence dropped significantly from 71.7 to 23.9% within the Dagana district. Young animals showed a significantly lower antibody prevalence (7.9%, N = 114) than adults (25.3%, N = 217). RVF virus circulated at a low level in 1988-89 without any epizootic manifestation. The population turnover generated an important non-immune population potentially at risk."
"American journal of veterinary research","A live attenuated vaccine virus variant of Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus was developed by passaging a human isolate in tissue culture under the influence of the mutagen 5-fluorouracil. This virus variant (MV P12) has been assessed in this study as to its suitability as a vaccine, by testing its pathogenicity in young lambs and measuring its ability to induce a protective immune response. Even high doses of the vaccine virus failed to induce any of the clinical or histopathologic changes associated with classical RVF virus infection. Although the vaccine induced mild pyrexia when given in high doses, viremia was not induced. Neutralizing antibody and a protective immune response was elicited with even low doses of vaccine virus. These data, along with data of other workers on the lack of abortigenicity of this virus variant, indicate that the MV P12 variant of RVF virus is an excellent candidate for a safe and effective vaccine against RVF."
"Vaccine","A previous study demonstrated that a mutagen-attenuated Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) vaccine, RVF MP-12, was immunogenic and non-abortogenic when ewes, 90-110 days pregnant, were inoculated with 5 x 10(5) plaque-forming units (p.f.u.) of the virus strain. The ewes delivered live, healthy lambs that had no neutralizing antibody to RVFV until after they had ingested colostrum. To assess further the safety and protective capability of this candidate vaccine, six pregnant ewes were inoculated with 5 x 10(3) p.f.u. of RVF MP-12 and challenged with 5 x 10(5) p.f.u. of virulent ZH-501 strain of RVFV 30 days later. No viraemia was detected after vaccination or challenge and all six ewes delivered live, healthy lambs. Those lambs tested before their nursing did not have neutralizing antibody to RVFV but quickly acquired antibody titres of 1:320 to greater than or equal to 1:10,240 after ingesting colostrum. To test the safety of the RVF MP-12 immunogen in neonates, lambs less than or equal to 7 days old, born to unvaccinated ewes, were inoculated with 5 x 10(5) p.f.u. of RVF MP-12. With the exception of brief pyrexia in 18 of 26 lambs, and a transient low-titred viraemia in 16 of 26 lambs after inoculation, no untoward effects were observed. Serum-neutralizing antibody to RVFV was detected 5-7 days after inoculation. Lambs vaccinated with either 5 x 10(5) or 5 x 10(3) p.f.u. of RVF MP-12 were protected against virulent RVFV challenge at 14 days postvaccination."

"Bulletin de la Société de pathologie exotique (1990)","A serosurvey of Rift Valley Fever virus infection conducted among 557 sheep and 643 goats from Niger in 1986 points out that 2.8% of the 1,200 animals tested had RVF virus reacting antibodies. The circulation of the virus is demonstrated, as well for another phlebovirus related to RVF virus, the strain Arumowot."
"Archives of virology","A panel of 17 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to the G1 and G2 envelope glycoproteins of Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus were used to analyze the topography and functional properties of the viral antigenic sites. Four heterogeneous antigenic regions which may be interlinked were identified on the G1 protein and four distinct domains on the G2 protein by competitive binding assays. Comparison of the biological activities and epitope specificities of the MAbs against G1 showed that the antigenic domains I, II, and IV were involved in virus neutralization and haemagglutination at different potencies. For both the G1 and G2 proteins, determinants mapping to domain G1 Ia and G2 Ia were associated with very strong neutralization independent of complement (C'), suggesting that they represent biologically important areas. Domain G2 II was involved in haemagglutination and weak C' dependent neutralization while the other two G2 regions had no haemagglutination function and neutralized to a low level only in the presence of C'. Epitopes Ia and IIb on G1 and Ia and IIa on G2 were also associated with protection of mice against virulent RVFV infection, indicating that both envelope glycoproteins play an important role in RVF viral infection and pathogenesis."
"Veterinary research communications","Sera from five traditionally managed herds grazing in the Kafue flats were tested for antibodies to bovine viral diarrhoea-mucosal disease (BVD-MD), parainfluenza 3 (PI3), infectious bovine rhinotracheitis-infectious pustular vulvovaginitis (IBR-IPV), bovine adenovirus 3 (BAV3) and Bluetongue (BT). The sero-prevalences of the first four diseases were respectively 76.2, 94.4, 42.1 and 87.4%. Five samples (2.3%) gave doubtful reactions for BT. Prevalences of 28.5% for brucellosis, 14% for Rift Valley fever (RFV), 0.9% for Q fever and 11.2% for chlamydiosis were also recorded. Significantly higher values for BVD-MD (p less than 0.005), IBR-IPV (p less than 0.01) and brucellosis (p less than 0.05) were found in animals over 1 year of age. No differences were recorded between herds or between male and female animals. The high concentration of wild and domestic ruminants grazing together in the flood plains during the dry season may be a major determinant of the high values observed. Traditional farmers, slaughterhouse workers and other people involved in livestock production are particularly at risk of contracting brucellosis and RVF because of the high prevalences in cattle and local habits favourable to their transmission."
"The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene","We studied the ability of Culex pipiens, Aedes circumluteolus, and Ae. mcintoshi, exposed as larvae to liver tissue from a Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus-infected hamster, to become infected and transstadially transmit virus to the adult and for the adults to transmit virus by bite to hamsters. After exposure as larvae, 9% (5/54) of adult Cx. pipiens and 8% (38/505) of the adult Ae. (Neomelaniconion) species were infected. All of the infected Cx. pipiens and about half of the infected Ae. circumluteolus and Ae. mcintoshi tested transmitted RVF virus by bite to hamsters. Transmission rates for mosquitoes orally infected as larvae were higher than those for mosquitoes orally infected as adults. Animals infected with RVF virus may abort or die in the vicinity of mosquito larvae breeding habitats and infected tissue from these animals may contaminate the water."
"Journal of the American Mosquito Control Association","Effectiveness of sustained-release Altosid pellets (4% AI methoprene) against floodwater mosquitoes in dambos treated at 5, 3, and 1 wk before and 1 day after flooding was determined. Only 2% of Aedes pupae (primarily Aedes mcintoshi) survived to adults in an area treated 5 wk preflood, and no adult mosquitoes emerged from an area treated 1 day after flooding. In contrast, 12 and 16% of Aedes pupae successfully survived to the adult stage in areas pretreated 3 and 1 wk, respectively, preflood. The effectiveness of the Altosid declined against Culex spp. (primarily Cx. antennatus) collected from dambos 15-31 days after flooding. The potential for using preflood treatment with methoprene to control Aedes vectors of Rift Valley fever virus in endemic areas is discussed."
"Journal of medical entomology","The mosquito Culex (Culex) theileri Theobald is probably the major vector of Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus during epizootics on the inland plateau of southern Africa. A cell line was established from the tissues of this mosquito species to facilitate laboratory studies on RVF and other arboviruses. After temperature pretreatment, egg rafts from a laboratory colony were disinfected, mechanically disrupted, and grown in preconditioned Eagles minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The cells were characterized by their protein content, karyology, and their susceptibility to three arboviruses. Although high infectivity titers were obtained, no cytopathic effects were produced by these viruses. The cell line was shown to be free from latent viruses. These results show that this cell line may be employed fruitfully in arbovirus studies."
"Virus research","A cDNA corresponding to the complete coding region of the M RNA of the M12 mutant of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) strain ZH548 (K. Takehara, M-K. Min, J.K. Battles, K. Sugiyama, V.C. Emery, J.M. Dalrymple, and D.H.L. Bishop, Virology, 169, 452-457, 1989) has been inserted into the baculovirus transfer vector pAcYM1. By comparison with the parent RVFV, the M RNA of the M12 mutant has a new small open reading frame (ORF1) upstream of the one that initiates the precursor of the viral glycoproteins (ORF2, gene order: NS(M)-G2-G1). A derivative of the M12 cDNA was prepared from which most of the upstream sequences (including a polyT tract and ORF1) were removed. Other cDNA constructs were made from this derivative, constructs in which most of the G1 sequences were also removed, or most of the NS(M) coding sequences, or all of the NS(M) and most of G2 coding sequences. Each RVFV M cDNA construct was inserted into a pAcYM1 transfer vector and recombinant baculoviruses were produced (RVM1-5). The derived viruses were employed to study the expression and properties of the RVFV glycoproteins in Spodoptera frugiperda insect cells. For each recombinant virus evidence was obtained which indicated that the RVFV glycoproteins were produced and processed in the insect cells. Although four of the recombinants gave low expression levels of the RVFV glycoproteins, for the vector that made only the G1 product, the expression level was significantly higher. Immunofluorescence analyses established that the RVFV glycoproteins were present both at intracellular locations and on the surface of the recombinant baculovirus infected insect cells."
"The Journal of general virology","Reassortant viruses containing heterologous S and M genomic RNA segments were obtained from both mosquito and vertebrate hosts that had been coinfected with Egyptian and Senegalese strains of Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus. The origin of the S and M RNA segments in each plaque-cloned virus was determined with monoclonal antibodies capable of differentiating the nucleocapsid protein (S segment marker) or the G1 glycoprotein (M segment marker) of the parental strains. In the mosquito Culex pipiens, reassortants were detected after sequential ingestion of parental viruses by interrupted feeding on two infected hamster hosts, after feeding on a single host that had been infected with both parental strains, and from individual mosquitoes inoculated intrathoracically with both parental strains. Reassortant viruses replicated efficiently in mosquitoes and were readily transmissible by bite to hamsters. Replication of a second infecting strain of RVF virus was, however, completely inhibited if that virus was inoculated into a mosquito greater than or equal to 48 h after the first viral strain. Genetic reassortment may provide a mechanism for increased heterogeneity, and thus affect the epidemiology and evolution of RVF virus."
"Medical and veterinary entomology","Measurements of green-leaf vegetation dynamics recorded by the advanced very high resolution radiometer instruments onboard National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration satellites 7 and 9 were used to derive ground moisture and rainfall patterns in Kenya and monitor resultant flooding of mosquito larval habitats (dambos) likely to support Rift Valley Fever virus vector mosquitoes (Aedes and Culex spp.). Satellite-derived data from mid-1981 to December 1988 have been analysed with corresponding rainfall, flooding and vector population data as they relate to Rift Valley Fever virus ecology. Single (7 x 7 km) and multiple grid-cell image analysis (200 x 300 km) in small localized areas and large geographical regions, respectively, of vegetation data were used to quantify the potential for flooding of mosquito breeding habitats. The ability to detect accurately parameters, such as ground moisture, that determine flooding could provide local officials with sufficient warning to allow for implementation of specific mosquito control measures before a disease outbreak."
"Vaccine","A live-attenuated vaccine for Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), MP-12, has been developed recently by undirected, serial mutagenesis of a RVFV strain (ZH548) isolated during the 1977 epidemic in Egypt. In the present study, the mutations responsible for attenuation of this virus have been examined by analysis of reassortant viruses generated between the vaccine strain and a wild RVFV strain isolated in Senegal. Reassortant viruses were generated efficiently in multiply infected Vero cells, and were readily isolated without application of selective pressures. The origin of the S and M genomic RNA segments in each cloned reassortant virus was determined with monoclonal antibodies capable of differentiating the nucleocapsid protein (S segment marker) or G1 glycoprotein (M segment marker) of the parental strains. The L segment of the vaccine strain was found to contain a temperature-sensitive (ts) mutation, and the origin of the L segment in most reassortants could be inferred by analysis of their ts phenotype. Analysis of the virulence properties of selected reassortant viruses in mice demonstrated that virulence characteristics were under polygenic control, and that at least one mutation capable of independently attenuating the virus existed on each genome segment. The L and M RNA segments were also found to contain ts mutations. These findings suggest that reversion to virulence is unlikely, and further indicate that genetic reassortment with wild-type viruses during a vaccination programme in endemic areas would also be expected to yield attenuated variants."
"Journal of the Egyptian Society of Parasitology","Mosquitoes are among the most annoying and important vectors of human and animal diseases as malaria, filariasis, yellow fever, rift valley fever...etc. In this paper, it was aimed to study the present status of species of genus Culex in the Suez Canal Governorates after the reconstruction and developmental projects. Five species of Culex were identified: C. pipiens, C. univittatus, C. antennatus, C. poicilipes and C. pusillus. The latter species was represented by two specimens. C. pipiens was the commonest species both indoors and outdoors. C. antennatus and C. poicilipes were found only outdoors. C. pipiens was found all the year round particularly in Spring. Other species were found in Spring and Autumn, except C. antennatus which was found in Summer as well. The results were discussed on the light of work done before."

"Veterinary microbiology","Ephemeral fever occurs in Kenya in epidemics which have been associated with periods of unusually heavy and prolonged rainfall. The epidemics persist for 2-3 years and involve most of the country. They occur in the same years as epizootics of Rift Valley fever, which is a mosquito-borne Phlebovirus infection. Sporadic outbreaks of the disease have been associated with local heavy rains; though one outbreak occurred during a dry period. Culicoides spp. were generally present in large numbers at the site of the outbreaks. Seroconversions were detected in sentinel cattle, when there had been no apparent clinical disease."
"Journal of virology","The middle (M) RNA segment of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) encodes four proteins: the major viral glycoproteins G2 and G1, a 14-kilodalton (kDa) protein, and a 78-kDa protein. These proteins are derived from a single large open reading frame (ORF) present in the virus-complementary M-segment mRNA. We used recombinant vaccinia viruses in which sequences representing the M-segment ORF were engineered as a surrogate system to study phlebovirus protein expression. To investigate the translational initiation codon requirements for synthesis of these proteins, we constructed a series of vaccinia virus recombinants containing specific sequence changes which eliminated select ATG codons found in the region of the ORF preceding the mature glycoprotein-coding sequences (the preglycoprotein region). Examination of phleboviral proteins synthesized in cells infected with these vaccinia virus recombinants clearly showed that the first ATG of the ORF was required for the production of the 78-kDa protein, while synthesis of the 14-kDa protein was absolutely dependent on the second in-phase ATG codon. Efficient biosynthesis of glycoprotein G2 was shown to depend on one or more ATG codons within the preglycoprotein region, but not the first one of the ORF. Synthesis of about one-half of the total glycoprotein G1 was affected by the amino acid changes that eliminated ATG codons, while production of the remainder appeared to be independent of all ATG codons in the preglycoprotein region. These data indicated that the means for glycoprotein G1 biosynthesis was distinct from those of the other three M-segment gene products. The results presented herein suggest that a surprisingly complex expression strategy is employed by the RVFV M segment. Although the full nature of the mechanisms involved in the biogenesis of the four RVFV M-segment proteins remains unclear, it does involve the use of at least two (ATG codons 1 and 2), and likely more, distinct translation start sites within the same ORF to produce its complete complement of gene products."

"The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene","Studies were conducted to determine if the sand fly Phlebotomus duboscqi could serve as a vector of Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus. When 145 P. duboscqi were fed on a hamster with RVF viremia (approximately 10(9) PFU/ml of blood), 72 (50%) became infected. Of 5 with disseminated infections (i.e., virus recovered from their legs) 4 transmitted virus to hamsters by bite. Sand flies were uniformly infected when RVF virus was inoculated by the intrathoracic route, and each of 31 sand flies so inoculated that fed on a hamster transmitted virus. None of 331 progeny of inoculated sand flies or 230 progeny of orally exposed sand flies contained virus. Sand flies could serve as vectors of RVF virus."

"Archives of virology","The hamster, Mesocricetus auratus, was examined as a possible model for investigating the poorly defined pathogenesis of the family Bunyaviridae, genus Phlebovirus. Punta Toro virus (PTV) isolates from Eastern Panama were highly virulent for two outbred and five inbred hamster strains, while isolates from western Panama were of low virulence. The Adames strain (eastern Panama) of PTV (LD50 approximately 1 PFU, sc) caused an acute fatal disease (average survival time, 3.8 days) in 10-week-old Lak: LVG (SYR) hamsters. Severe necrosis of the liver, spleen, and small intestine was associated with extensive expression of viral antigen in these organs. The Balliet strain (western Panama) of PTV (LD50 greater than 6 log10 PFU, subcutaneously) caused a mild hepatocellular infection with peak viral liver titers of 3-4 log10 PFU/g compared to 8-9 log10 PFU/g for the Adames strain. We observed histological lesions in the red pulp of the spleen or the lamina propria of the small intestine with the Adames strain. Lesions in the hamsters had characteristics of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The PTV-hamster model shares similarities to Rift Valley fever (phleboviral disease), which causes fatal disease in man and domesticated ruminants."

"Archives of virology","Rhesus monkeys inoculated intravenously with Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus presented clinical disease syndromes similar to human cases of RVF. All 17 infected monkeys had high-titered viremias but disease ranged from clinically inapparent to death. Three (18%) RVF virus-infected monkeys developed signs of hemorrhagic fever characterized by epistaxis, petechial to purpuric cutaneous lesions, anorexia, and vomiting prior to death. The 14 remaining monkeys survived RVF viral infection but, 7 showed clinical signs of illness characterized by diminished food intake, cutaneous petechiae, and occasional vomiting. The other 7 monkeys showed no evidence of clinical disease. All monkeys had detectable serum interferon 24-30 h after infection, but 4 of 7 monkeys that did not develop clinical illness had serum interferon titers within 12 h after infection. In lethally infected macaques, indices of hepatic function and blood coagulation were abnormal within 2 days, implicating early pathogenetic events as critical determinants of survival. Serum transferase values were elevated in proportion to severity of clinical disease and outcome of infection. Both myocardial damage and laboratory evidence consistent with disseminated intravascular coagulation were present in fatal infections. All surviving monkeys developed neutralizing antibodies to RVF virus 4-7 days after infection, and this coincided with termination of viremia. Two fatally infected monkeys were viremic until death on days 6 and 8, and the third cleared viremia on day 5 and developed antibody on day 6 but died on day 15. There was a significant correlation between a delayed interferon response and mortality, suggesting that the early appearance of interferon was influential in limiting the severity of disease."

"Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene","Sera collected in May 1984 from 132 adult residents of Karamoja district, Uganda, were examined by haemagglutination inhibition tests for antibodies against selected arboviruses, namely Chikungunya and Semliki Forest alphaviruses (Togaviridae); dengue type 2, Wesselsbron, West Nile, yellow fever and Zika flaviviruses (Flaviviridae); Bunyamwera, Ilesha and Tahyna bunyaviruses (Bunyaviridae); and Sicilian sandfly fever phlebovirus (Bunyaviridae); and by immunofluorescence tests against certain haemorrhagic fever viruses, Lassa fever arenavirus (Arenaviridae), Ebola-Sudan, Ebola-Zaïre and Marburg filoviruses (Filoviridae), Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever nairovirus and Rift Valley fever phlebovirus (Bunyaviridae). Antibodies against Chikungunya virus were the most prevalent (47%), followed by flavivirus antibodies (16%), which were probably due mainly to West Nile virus. No evidence of yellow fever or dengue virus circulation was observed. A few individuals had antibodies against Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever, Lassa, Ebola and Marburg viruses, suggesting that these viruses all circulate in the area."
"The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene","Ribavirin was evaluated as a potential therapeutic for Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF). Viral yields for strains of CCHF virus from Europe, Asia, and Africa in African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells were markedly reduced by this drug. Some CCHF viral strains appeared more sensitive than others, but in general, ribavirin doses as low as 5 micrograms/ml caused a transient reduction of viral yields. A further reduction in viral yields was induced by a dose of 25 micrograms/ml, and evidence of viral replication was not demonstrated in cells treated with 50 or 250 micrograms/ml. In contrast, a dose of ribavirin at least 9 times greater was required to induce a comparable inhibitory effect on the yields of Rift Valley fever virus, for which the drug has been shown to inhibit replication in monkeys and rodents."
"The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene","We exposed Hyalomma truncatum and Rhipicephalus appendiculatus to Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus in order to assess the possible role of these ticks as enzootic/epizootic RVF vectors. The virus replicated in H. truncatum after intracoelomic inoculation, and a minimum transmission rate of 17% was achieved after 15 days intrinsic incubation. The virus persisted at least 58 days in these ticks. Virus was also shown to pass transstadially from inoculated H. truncatum nymphs to adults, with peak viral titers reaching 10(3.5) plaque-forming units (PFU) in adult males after they were provided with bloodmeals. Virus was recovered from adult females 121 days after they were inoculated as nymphs. Viral titers peaked in inoculated male ticks after dropping off a host (mean titer = 10(4.3) PFU). RVF virus was not detected in pools of eggs and larval progeny from 11 infected female H. truncatum. H. truncatum larvae and nymphs did not become infected after ingesting greater than 10(2.0) PFU while feeding on a RVF viremic hamster. The number of infected specimens declined rapidly after RVF virus was inoculated into R. appendiculatus adults, and virus was undetectable 12 days post-inoculation."
"Journal of medical virology","Epidemics of a malaria-like illness affected several thousand residents of the Dam Camp, a refugee camp near Hargeysa in Somalia, during 1985, 1986, and 1987. The disease was characterized by fever, chills, sweats, headache, back and joint pains for as long as 10 days in some patients. Blood smears from acutely ill patients were negative for malaria. Of 28 acute and 10 convalescent sera tested by the indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) and by the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) tests, all were negative for antibody to Rift Valley fever, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, Sindbis, Chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika viruses. However, antibody reactive to dengue 2 virus was detected by the IFA test in 39% (15/38), and 11 of 29 (38%) of the same sera were antibody positive by the HI test. Also, IgG antibody reactive to dengue 2 was demonstrated in 60% (17/28) of the same sera by the enzyme immunoassay (EIA), and 14% (4/28) were positive for IgM antibody. Of ten patients for which acute and convalescent sera were available, two developed four fold or greater rises in antibody titer evidencing infection. These data suggested that dengue virus may have been the cause of the epidemic among the Dam Camp refugees."

"Journal of medical virology","Virus-like particles (60-70 nm) with spiked surfaces budding into cell vacuoles and rod-shaped inclusions were detected in nuclei of hepatocytes from a British patient transplanted for sporadic non-A, non-B fulminant hepatitis (NANB-FHF), probably contracted in Kenya. Identical particles were seen in two successive grafts (days 2 and 10) at regrafting for recurrent FHF. Ultrastructural features resembled those of the RNA-containing arbovirus, Rift Valley fever virus, but serological markers against a representative panel for arboviruses (Togaviruses) and transmission in mice proved negative. The particles shared features with the different arboviruses seen in the hepatectomy specimen of a second patient with NANB-FHF, and in both patients an insect vector was implicated in the clinical history. The particles were identical in size to those of a third patient with NANB-FHF, who had remained in the United Kingdom. These findings, together with the recent report of isolation of an RNA-containing virus resembling the Togaviridae, in parenteral NANB, suggest that several exotic virus-like agents resembling the arboviruses may be involved in the aetiology of NANB, including in the sporadic forms of FHF in the United Kingdom."

"Virology","The M segment RNA of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) encodes four gene products: the two viral envelop glycoproteins G2 and G1, a glycosylated 78-kDa protein, and a nonglycosylated 14-kDa protein. These proteins are generated from a single open reading frame (ORF) by a strategy involving independent translational initiations at both the first and second in-phase ATG codons and co-translational processing of primary polyprotein products. The ORF encodes six sites for N-linked glycosylation: one present in the ""preglycoprotein region"" preceding the coding sequences of the mature envelop glycoproteins, and within the coding sequences of both the 78- and 14-kDa proteins; one site in the glycoprotein G2 coding region, also present in the 78-kDa protein; and four sites within glycoprotein G1. From analyses of RVFV proteins produced in cells infected with recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing various M segment regions, we show glycoprotein G2 was glycosylated at its single site and glycoprotein G1 at at least three sites. Both sites for N-linked glycosylation in the 78-kDa protein were occupied with glycan. This latter result indicated the preglycoprotein region glycosylation site was utilized in the 78-kDa protein, but this same site within the 14-kDa protein was not. Further analysis showed utilization of this glycosylation site, as well as proteolytic processing at the amino terminus of the mature glycoprotein G2, appeared to be determined by initiation codon usage. The two-site translational initiation expression strategy of this phlebovirus M segment and its role in the control of post-translational protein modification and processing are discussed."
"Reviews of infectious diseases","Rift Valley fever (RVF) is an important cause of disease in animals and humans in sub-Saharan Africa. In a small percentage of human cases, the disease is complicated by hemorrhage, which often is associated with a fatal outcome. Inoculation of rhesus monkeys with the Zagazig Hospital strain of RVF virus produced a clinical picture similar to illness in humans. Ten of 17 monkeys developed clinical evidence of hemostatic impairment. When coagulation tests were performed, this group of monkeys had significant abnormalities, including evidence for disseminated intravascular coagulation. These abnormalities were much less pronounced in the remaining seven monkeys-whose only sign of illness was transient fever-and, in general, they paralleled the level of viremia and the degree of elevation in levels of serum hepatic enzymes. Autopsy of the three monkeys with severe disease revealed hepatic necrosis."
"The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene","Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus infection, dissemination, and transmission rates were determined for Aedes fowleri, Aedes mcintoshi and Culex pipiens 7 or 10 days after sequentially feeding to repletion on RVF virus immune hamsters and RVF viremic hamsters, or after feeding on a mixture of RVF virus immune sheep serum and RVF viremic hamster blood through a pledget. No significant differences in infection or dissemination rates were detected among Ae. fowleri and Cx. pipiens feeding to repletion on immune hamsters before or after feeding to repletion on a viremic hamster. Similarly, no significant differences in infection, dissemination, or transmission rates were observed among Ae. fowleri and Cx. pipiens feeding to repletion on immune hamsters or nonimmune (control) hamsters 0 or 24 hr after inoculation with RVF virus. Infection rates were significantly higher for Ae. fowleri (56/66, 85%) and Cx. pipiens (123/148, 83%) fed only on viremic hamsters than for those interrupted to complete feeding on an immune hamster (Ae. fowleri [24/49, 59%], Cx. pipiens [66/131, 50%]) or a nonimmune hamster (Ae. fowleri [32/51, 63%], Cx. pipiens [69/127, 54%]).

"Research in virology","During the Mauritanian Rift Valley fever (RVF) epidemic of 1987, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were studied from 78 sick patients. RVF virus (RVFV) was isolated in 5 cases, on Aedes pseudoscutellaris AP61, from both PBMC and serum. Among the 78 cases studied, RVF was proven in 19 cases (24.3%) by specific IgM detection, and in 12 cases (15.3%) by virus isolation from serum, of which 3 also exhibited anti-RVF IgM. Among the 5 PBMC-positive RVFV cases, 2 strains were isolated in the presence of specific IgM from patients presenting with neurologic signs. These observations raised the question as to the role of specific IgM in cellular infection, and suggest that, in certain cases, mononuclear cells may promote RVFV dissemination into brain cells. Further investigations need to be undertaken to determine the RVFV receptor expressed on PBMC membranes."

The patient's history of travel in Africa, visits to rural areas, contact with sick animals or their carcasses, or contact with a tick-infested environment or tick bites is important. Rift Valley fever is characterized by an incubation period of approximately 3 or 4 days, sudden onset of fever with a biphasic course, and signs and symptoms of liver and kidney disorder. The commonest complication is retinitis with a central scotoma. Severe cases may develop a hemorrhagic state, which may be fatal. Marburg virus disease was studied in two Australian students after a tour of Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) and in a nurse who cared for them. The incubation period of approximately 7 days is followed by sudden onset of fever (typically lasting 7 days) and the appearance of a maculopapular petechial rash on the 5th day. A hemorrhagic state develops about the same time and may be fatal. Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever is widespread in South Africa; it may be transmitted by tick bite of the species Hyalomma, by contact with the tissues of animals, or by contact with infected patients."
"Reviews of infectious diseases","Although many viral infections have on occasion been associated with hemorrhagic complications, infection with any of several RNA viruses regularly results in vascular involvement and the syndrome called viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF). In spite of clinically useful similarities among various VHFs, there are significant differences in their pathogenesis and clinical evolution; these are often related to characteristics of their viral taxon. Infection with Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus, a phlebovirus, appears to be regulated by interferon and terminated by neutralizing antibody. In contrast, Lassa fever (LF) virus, an arenavirus, is resistant to interferon, and LF is terminated by cellular immune effector mechanisms. The lytic virus-cell interaction typical of RVF virus suggests its major effects occur by direct, virus-induced cellular necrosis, particularly in the liver. In the primate RVF model, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) may be important. LF virus--characteristically noncytopathic--may exert its effects through induction of mediator secretion from infected macrophages. DIC does not appear to be a central pathogenetic mechanism in LF. Pichinde virus, which is not pathogenic for humans, provides an alternate model for study of LF. Infected guinea pigs do not show histologic lesions that could explain their body wasting, cardiovascular deterioration, and pulmonary edema. In the heart, for example, loss of tissue mass, protein, and contractile function proceed without direct viral involvement or myocarditis. Sulfidopeptide leukotrienes have been implicated as one relevant soluble mediator participating in the disease state."
"Reviews of infectious diseases","Monocytes play a central role in protection against many viruses. In some infections they are target cells for viral replication. There is increasing evidence that these cells may also be important in regulation of hemostasis. The part played by monocytic cells in the pathogenesis of hemorrhage in the viral hemorrhagic fevers is presently uncertain. Monocytes and monocytic cell lines have been used to investigate the ability of viruses to infect these cells in vitro. Several factors may affect the ability of a particular virus to infect monocytic cells, including specific antiserum to virus and the degree of cellular maturation. The effect of cellular maturation on the replication of Rift Valley fever virus in the U937 cell line is discussed in light of studies on the infectivity of other viruses for monocytic cells. Data supporting the ability of specific antibody to enhance the infectivity of Pichinde virus and Lassa fever virus for U937 cells are presented."
"Virology","Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis viral recombinants containing coding information for the Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) envelope glycoproteins (G1 and G2) and varying amounts of preglycoprotein coding sequences were prepared by using transfer vectors pAc373 or pAcYM1. Expression products were processed to yield proteins indistinguishable from authentic G1 and G2 by gel electrophoresis. The immunogenic properties of the expressed proteins were assessed by immunizing mice and challenging with RVFV. A single inoculation with lysates of cells infected with recombinants expressing both G1 and G2 induced neutralizing antibody responses in mice and protected them from an otherwise lethal challenge with RVFV. Lysates of cells infected with a recombinant expressing only G2 also induced a protective response after two immunizations. Survivors displayed elevated antibody titers to G1 and G2 and also developed antibodies to the RVFV nucleocapsid protein, the latter allowing discrimination from vaccinated mice and indicating that animals had survived infection. Nonimmune mice were protected from lethal RVFV infection by passive transfer of sera from animals immunized with recombinant antigens, indicating that a humoral immune response is sufficient to protect against RVFV."
"Reviews of infectious diseases","Prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of recombinant leukocyte A interferon (rIFN-alpha A) and Sendai virus-induced human leukocyte interferon (HuIFN-alpha) administered intramuscularly to Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV)-infected rhesus monkeys was studied. Clinical, virologic, immunologic, and hemostatic parameters were monitored. Five daily inoculations of 5 X 10(5) units of either interferon product per kilogram of body weight, initiated 24 hours before or 6 hours after RVFV infection, prevented or greatly suppressed viremia. No clinical signs of disease or laboratory evidence of impaired hemostasis was observed. Serum neutralizing antibody to RVFV was detected within 6 days of virus inoculation. Prophylactic administration of 5 X 10(4) or 5 X 10(3) units of rIFN-alpha A per kilogram also limited viremia, hepatocellular damage, and hemostatic derangement. Untreated, RVFV-infected, control monkeys developed high-titered viremia, clinical disease, and impaired hemostasis. These data suggest that rIFN-alpha A and HuIFN-alpha are effective in protecting RVFV-infected rhesus monkeys from viremia and hepatocellular damage and may be beneficial in human RVF infection."
"Reviews of infectious diseases","Ribavirin, a broad-spectrum antiviral drug, is active against hemorrhagic fever viruses (with the exception of Ebola virus) in cell culture systems. In model infections with arenaviruses in guinea pigs and monkeys, ribavirin has demonstrated both prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy. In therapeutic studies it has not prevented late-onset neurologic disease. In human cases of Lassa fever, it significantly reduces mortality when administered before day 7 of illness to persons at high risk. In rodents and monkeys infected with Rift Valley fever virus, ribavirin therapy resulted in reduced mortality; prophylactic administration to volunteers infected with sandfly fever virus, Sicilian strain, prevented development of illness. Ribavirin increased the number of survivors and the mean time to death in suckling mice infected with Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus and in suckling mice infected with Hantaan virus. In the People's Republic of China, ribavirin significantly reduced mortality in patients with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. Ribavirin has not been effective in animal models of filoviral and flaviviral infections. The only important adverse effect of ribavirin in humans is manageable, reversible anemia."
"Reviews of infectious diseases","Twelve distinct viruses associated with hemorrhagic fever in humans are classified among four families: Arenaviridae, which includes Lassa, Junin, and Machupo viruses; Bunyaviridae, which includes Rift Valley fever, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, and Hantaan viruses; Filoviridae, which includes Marburg and Ebola viruses; and Flaviviridae, which includes yellow fever, dengue, Kyasanur Forest disease, and Omsk viruses. Most hemorrhagic fever viruses are zoonoses, with the possible exception of the four dengue viruses, which may continually circulate among humans. Hemorrhagic fever viruses are found in both temperate and tropical habitats and generally infect both sexes and all ages, although the age and sex of those infected are frequently influenced by the possibility of occupational exposure. Transmission to humans is frequently by bite of an infected tick or mosquito or via aerosol from infected rodent hosts. Aerosol and nosocomial transmission are especially important with Lassa, Junin, Machupo, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, Marburg, and Ebola viruses. Seasonality of hemorrhagic fever among humans is influenced for the most part by the dynamics of infected arthropod or vertebrate hosts. Mammals, especially rodents, appear to be important natural hosts for many hemorrhagic fever viruses. The transmission cycle for each hemorrhagic fever virus is distinct and is dependent upon the characteristics of the primary vector species and the possibility for its contact with humans."
"Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene","Sera of 381 adult people from 5 areas in Madagascar were tested by the indirect immunofluorescence method for antibodies against Congo-Crimean haemorrhagic fever and Rift Valley fever viruses (Bunyaviridae), Ebola (strains Zaire and Sudan) and Marburg viruses (Filoviridae), and Lassa virus (Arenaviridae). The highest prevalence rate was that of Ebola virus (4.5%). As no haemorrhagic syndrome has been found associated with this virus, the possible presence of a less pathogenic, antigenically related, strain is discussed. The prevalences of Congo-Crimean haemorrhagic fever and Rift Valley viruses were very low, despite previous viral isolations from potential vectors. No serum reacted against Lassa or Marburg antigens. The results are analysed in the light of the geographical and bioecological characteristics of Madagascar, which is a true 'microcontinent' very different from the African mainland."
"Virology","The M RNA species of a candidate vaccine strain of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV ZH-548M12), derived by consecutive high level mutagenesis using 5-fluorouracil (H. Caplen, C. J. Peters, and D. H. L. Bishop, J. Gen. Virol., 66, 2271-2277, 1985), has been cloned and the cDNA sequenced. The data have been compared to those obtained for the parent virus strain RVFV ZH-548 as well as the previously published data for RVFV ZH-501 (M. S. Collett, A. F. Purchio, K. Keegan, S. Frazier, W. Hays, D. K. Anderson, M. D. Parker, C. Schmaljohn, J. Schmidt, and J. M. Dalrymple, Virology, 144, 228-245, 1985). Some eight nucleotide and three amino acid differences were identified between the M RNAs of ZH-501 and ZH-548. Between the M RNAs of ZH-548 and that of the M12 mutant there were 12 nucleotide and 7 amino acid changes. Unique to the mutant virus is a new AUG codon upstream of that which initiates the open reading frame of the RVFV M gene product (the viral glycoprotein precursor). The significance of this and other differences in the mutant RNA with regard to the derivation and potential attenuation of the candidate vaccine is discussed."
"Research in virology","Three epidemiological investigations were carried out during and after the 1987 Rift Valley fever (RVF) epidemic in South Mauritania: a case control study, a cross-sectional study in the town of Rosso and a cross-sectional study of villages and encampments around Rosso. The case control study showed an association between epizootic and epidemic outbreaks. The study in Rosso town showed housing and district effects. Also, a medical survey of hospital staff showed the absence of interhuman contamination. The cross-sectional study of villages and encampments around Rosso showed heterogeneity corresponding to a village and ethnic effect. The human epidemic was linked to epizootic disease, but the ""vectors"" of the disease are not as yet known."
"Research in virology","Studies were conducted to determine the effect of environmental temperature on the ability of Senegalese Aedes fowleri to transmit Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus. Temperatures tested included 17 degrees C, 28 degrees C and a cyclic (17-28 degrees C) regimen designed to mimic temperatures to which a mosquito might be exposed in October in southeastern Senegal. After per oral exposure, infection rates were similar (ca. 93%) for all three groups. However, RVF virus disseminated to the haemocoel more rapidly in mosquitoes held at higher temperatures, with peak dissemination rates (ca. 80%) reached at 11, 18 and greater than 42 days after the infectious blood meal for mosquitoes held at 28 degrees C, cyclic and 17 degrees C, respectively. Likewise, the time interval between ingestion of the viremic blood meal and the first transmission by bite was inversely related to environmental temperature, with the first transmission occurring at 11, 18 and 35 days for mosquitoes held at 28 degrees C, cyclic and 17 degrees C, respectively. After being transferred from 17 to 28 degrees C on days 7 or 14 after the infectious blood meal, mosquitoes rapidly developed a disseminated infection and transmitted virus by bite within 7 days. Environmental temperature significantly affected the vectorial capacity of A. fowleri for RVF virus, with transmission occurring earlier and at a higher rate in mosquitoes held at higher temperatures."
"Research in virology","Rhesus monkeys inoculated with Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus provide a model in which serial observations of serum viral antigen and antibodies can be made. In 9 non-fatal and 3 fatal infections, either antigen or IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) antibodies were detected in every serum sample during the acute phase. Furthermore, viral nucleic acid could be detected by filter hybridization in most samples taken on days 1 to 3. Circulation of significant quantities of viral RNA provides an additional approach to the diagnosis and study of RVF."
"Research in virology","Several cell cultures and animals were compared for their relative sensitivity as primary isolation systems for Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) and to determine if virulence characteristics of the isolates were altered in these systems. Eleven human sera from known cases of Rift Valley fever (RVF) were obtained from the 1987 epidemic in Mauritania and served as the source of virus for these studies. Sera were inoculated directly into cell cultures (Vero, C6/36 and DBS-FRhL-2) and animals (ICR suckling mice, Lak:LVG(SYR) hamsters and WF rats) concurrently. The cell lines provided a quick method to propagate, quantitate and identify these specimens without prior adaption. The isolates were highly virulent for suckling mice and hamsters, but not for WF rats, even after cell culture passage, which indicated that the Mauritanian isolates more closely resembled those strains from sub-Saharan Africa than those from the 1977-78 Egyptian epidemic."
"Research in virology","In order to collect epidemiological data about the Rift Valley fever epidemic in Mauritania, we decided to use the filter paper method. The mean recovery level of specific antibodies from filter paper, tested using an immunoenzymatic method, is around one fourth. Taking the mean haematocrit into account, we estimated the extract square with a 1/300 dilution. This method was very useful for epidemiological studies, we observed few patient refusals, but it is necessary to know the exact specificity of the antibodies."

"Research in virology","The antigenic and biological properties of three strains of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) isolated during the 1987 epidemic in Mauritania were compared with those of strains isolated previously in West Africa and with other selected African strains. Neither the antigenic characteristics of the Mauritanian isolates, as monitored by the binding of 59 monoclonal antibodies, nor the electrophoretic migration of the virus-specific structural and non-structural proteins were significantly different from other strains of RVFV isolated in this region or elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa. Biological and antigenic traits which distinguished the strains isolated from the 1977 Egyptian epidemic were not associated with the Mauritanian isolates."
"Bulletin de la Société de pathologie exotique et de ses filiales","A serosurvey of Rift valley fever virus infection has been conducted among 2,410 domestic ruminants (sheep, goats and cattle) from Burkina Faso in 1985, 1986 and 1987. An active circulation of virus was demonstrated and 26.7% of the total animal tested had Rift valley fever virus reacting antibodies. An epizootic was demonstrated retrospectively for 1987 and appears to correspond to the RVF outbreak observed in the same type of sahelian environment during the same year in Mauritania. Analogous ecoclimatic and environmental risk factors are discussed. Others phleboviruses such as Arumowot, Gordil, Saint-Floris, Gabek Forest and Odrenisrou seem to be active in some areas but no evidence of pathogenesis for domestic ruminants was demonstrated."
"Archives de l'Institut Pasteur de Madagascar","Some arboviruses are highly pathogenic for Men or animals, Arboviruses epidemiological patterns in Madagascar were determined by entomological, serological, and virological surveys. We listed potentials arboviruses vectors in Madagascar. Entomological results generated by us during five years, as well as prior to, are shown. We caught more than 150,000 hematophagous arthropods, belonging to 107 species at least. 3 of these species were new. 4183 inoculation pools were done. We studied serologically (by HI test) samples collected from 563 animals and 626 Men. Our data, in agreement with others collected from 1965 to 1982, demonstrate that arboviruses circulate in the whole island. Positive reactions were obtained mainly with Flavivirus, in particular with West-Nile. Nine various arboviruses, including dengue-2 virus isolated from an individual having travelled to La Réunion, have been isolated. Dakar-Bat and Mengo virus have been observed. We studied transmission cycles of the following viruses: Babanki, West-Nile, Rift Valley Fever, Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever, MMP 158, Ngari, Perinet and Andasibe; the last 2 being endemic. In relation to Madagascar biogeographic characteristics (long-term isolation, scarce communications, high endemicity, and low vertebrate density), we evaluated the risk of potential introduction and amplification of various arboviruses (dengue, yellow fever, japanese encephalitis, Sindbis and Chikungunya). The risk is very high for dengue due to the presence of susceptible mosquitoes strains while the virus circulates in East Africa and in the Indian Ocean area. This risk seems to be very low for yellow fever, and intermediate for other arboviruses."
"Research in virology","Severe haemorrhagic disease among the human population of the Senegal River Basin brought the Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) outbreak of 1987 to the attention of science. As in previous RVFV outbreaks, local herdsmen reported a high incidence of abortion and disease in their livestock. Serum samples were obtained from domestic animal populations from areas near Rosso, the best studied focus of human infection, as well as other areas distant from known human disease. Among animals from the area of high incidence of human disease, antibody prevalence was as high as 85%, with approximately 80% of the sera positive for both RVFV IgG- and viral-specific IgM antibodies. In contrast, human populations in the same area had lower RVFV antibody prevalences, 40% or less, with 90% also being IgM-positive. Sera from livestock in coastal areas 280 km south of the epidemic area were negative for RVFV antibodies. Thus, the detection of RVFV specific IgG and IgM antibodies provided evidence of recent disease activity without the requirement to establish pre-disease antibody levels in populations or individuals and without viral isolation. Subsequently, detection of modest levels of IgG and IgM in the Ferlo region, 130 km south of the Senegal River flood plain, established that RVFV transmission also occurred in another area of the basin. Similar serological testing of domestic ungulates in The Gambia, 340 km south of Rosso, demonstrated antibody prevalence consistent with a lower level of recent transmission of RVFV, i.e., 24% IgG-positive with 6% of the positive sera also having RVFV-specific IgM."
"Research in virology","Human sera collected during the 1987 Rift Valley fever (RVF) epidemic in the Senegal River basin were analysed using three enzyme immunoassays to establish the best method for rapid diagnosis of RVF. A biotin-avidin-enhanced antigen detection method utilizing monoclonal antibodies proved most sensitive. Eighty-two viremic human sera were tested, and this assay detected antigen in 29.3% of the samples."
"Research in virology","The Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) epidemic that occurred in southern Mauritania during the 1987 rainy season provided a unique opportunity to test and evaluate a recently developed, M-segment-specific, nucleic acid filter hybridization assay on a large collection of infected human serum samples. It afforded the opportunity to compare the procedure with two other methods for detecting virus: virus isolation and antigen detection by ELISA. The filter hybridization procedure employed a polyethylene-glycol-precipitation and proteinase-K-digestion sample treatment step developed specifically for preparing serum samples for hybridization. The procedure was less sensitive for detecting RVFV in the Mauritanian human viremic samples than in sera from experimentally infected monkeys used to evaluate this procedure. It was also less sensitive than an antigen detection procedure used to test the Mauritanian samples. However, we were able to detect virus RNA in a significant proportion of the virus-isolation-positive samples. Advances in sample preparation, labelling and detection procedures, and hybridization methods will improve the sensitivity, precision and ease of use of this assay and increase its value as a diagnostic tool."

"Research in virology","The Rift Valley fever epidemic, which arose in the south of Mauritania beginning on October 15, 1987, enabled a comparative study of different diagnostic methods among humans. During the first two weeks of the epidemic, four parallel methods were used: inoculation into Aedes pseudoscutellaris cells, inoculation intracerebrally into suckling mice, tests by immunocapture of the circulating antigen and detection of type IgM gammaglobulins. Of 370 examined sera, 181 showed at least one marker of recent infection. Inoculation into A. pseudoscutellaris cells was by far the most sensitive and easiest method to use. Detection of the antigen by immunocapture was also a useful technique, since it allowed quick aetiological diagnosis or examination of sera conserved under poor conditions. However, its sensitivity was weak, as it could only detect 26% of positive cases. Vero cells used on a limited scale, in this particular case seemed less sensitive than A. pseudoscutellaris cells. Of a total of 991 sera, 221 diagnoses were reported by discovery of the virus and 271 by detection of specific IgM. In every case, A. pseudoscutellaris cells seemed most appropriate as the system of reference."

Using clinical and biological data collected during the 1987 RVF epidemic in Southern Mauritania, we established a prognosis score card. Data analysis allows to prognosticate forms of possible severe evolution as an association of four syndromes: fever over 39 degrees, hemorrhagic syndrome, icterus and neurological signs. Using 12 clinical symptoms and 3 biological signs, it is possible to prognosticate cases with fatal evolution."
"Bulletin de la Société de pathologie exotique et de ses filiales","During and after a Rift Valley fever (RVF) epidemic in Southern Mauritania we collected 600 clinical observations. 348 were confirmed to be RVF cases. We described 5 major clinical aspects: mild, icteric, icterohemorrhagic, hemorrhagic and neurological forms. The first one is the most frequently seen with 42.8% of the cases at admission. Fever was associated with various pains (cephalalgia, myalgia, arthralgia) and an important asthenia. Inconsistently this syndrome was accompanied by epistaxis and conjunctival hyperemia. The icteric form, never described before, is an icterus occurring during evolution of a mild form. It represents 28.5% of total cases at admission. The great number of theses mild forms implies that they could be used as excellent markers for an epidemic emergence."

An icterus was associated with hemorrhagic signs, varying from gingivorrhagia to abundant bleeding. Biological hepato-nephritis was always present in major hemorrhagic forms. Fulminant forms, spectacular and characteristic are excellent markers for epidemiological studies in the field."

"The Journal of the Egyptian Public Health Association","Previous investigations have delt with colonized Cx. pipiens and RVF virus interactions. This study evaluated the vector competence of parental Cx. pipiens populations for RVF virus and investigated variations in the vector competence among different geographic strains of this mosquito in Egypt. Cx. pipiens females were fed on viremic hamsters circulating 9.4-10.5 log10 SMICLD50 of virus. Mosquito samples were freezed at different intervals extending between 0-12 days of extrinsic incubation (EI). Transmission experiments started at day 5 of EI when individual females were allowed to refeed on normal hamsters. The infection rates for the geographic strains tested ranged between 85% and 100% and the transmission rates ranged between 6% and 35%. Transmission of RVF virus to normal hamsters took place at days 9, 12, 15 and 18 of EI by the different tested Cx. pipiens strains. Transmitter females contained significantly more virus than the non-transmitters except for the strain of Giza. Most of the infected Cx. pipiens individuals were of the non-transmitting type even those with high titers. Barriers at the salivary gland level competing RVF virus transmission are probably present in Egyptian Cx. pipiens. RVG virus infection was observed to adversely affect Cx. pipiens. The present investigation revealed no geographic variations in the vector competence of Egyptian Cx. pipiens for RVF virus."

"The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene","Infection rates were compared in Culex pipiens and Aedes taeniorhynchus after they fed on Rift Valley fever (RVF) viremic hamsters or ingested similar doses of RVF virus from blood-soaked pledgets. Infection rates were significantly lower for mosquitoes that ingested virus from a pledget than for those that ingested similar doses from viremic hamsters. The method used to prevent normal clot formation for the pledget feedings (i.e., defibrination by shaking with glass beads or addition of heparin) did not affect subsequent infection rates. Both inhibition of normal clot formation and freezing of virus after it had last been propagated were associated with significantly reduced infection rates with the pledget feedings. Laboratory studies using artificial feeding techniques may not give reliable estimates of the vector competence of mosquitoes for arboviruses."
"Journal of virological methods","Heating for 1 h at 60 degrees C completely destroyed the infectivity of sucrose-acetone-extracted antigen of Rift Valley (RVF) and Congo Crimean haemorrhagic fever (CCHF), as well as of RVF- and CCHF-infected mouse brain. These antigens could be successfully used, however, for complement fixation and IgM-capturing enzyme immunoassay. Vero E6 cell suspensions infected with hantaviruses such as Hantaan 76-118, Tchoupitoulas, SR 11, GB-B, CG 18-20, Hällnäs, CG 13891, Seoul and Prospect Hill, as well as Vero cells infected with CCHF and RVF viruses, were completely inactivated after heating for 1 h at 60 degrees C. Indirect immunofluorescent antibody test results obtained on slides prepared with heat-inactivated cell suspensions correlated well with results obtained on slides prepared with unheated cell suspensions.

"Antiviral research","Ribamidine (1-beta-D-ribofuranosyl-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamidine) was inhibitory in rhesus monkey kidney (LLC-MK2 derivative) cells to Adames and Balliet strains of Punta Toro virus (PTV), a Phlebovirus related to Rift Valley fever and sandfly fever viruses. The 50% effective dose was 8 and 12 micrograms/ml against each respective virus strain; the 50% cytotoxic dose was 320 micrograms/ml, giving selectivity indices of 40 and 27 against each virus strain. The virus ratings were 1.2 and 1.0, respectively. In radiolabel uptake studies, ribamidine had a moderate effect on [3H]leucine uptake at dosages down to 1 microgram/ml, but [3H]thymidine, [32P], and [3H]uridine were inhibited at high (100-1000 micrograms/ml) doses only. Subcutaneous (s.c.) and oral treatments of Adames PTV-infected mice were equally highly effective, as evidenced particularly by 100% survivors. Reduced hepatic icterus, serum oxalic acid transaminase, serum glutamic pyruvic acid transaminase, and recoverable virus titers from livers and sera of infected mice were also seen as a result of ribamidine treatment. Twice daily treatment for 5 days could be started as late as 72 h post-virus inoculation (p.v.i.) with significant inhibition of PTV infection seen. Single s.c. treatments administered as late as 48 h p.v.i. were similarly effective. Using the chronic therapy schedule, the maximum tolerated dose was 1000 mg/kg/day and the minimum effective dose was 31.3 to 62.5 mg/kg/day. Using single treatment, a maximum tolerated dose was greater than 1000 mg/kg, and the minimum effective dose was 125 mg/kg. Ribamidine s.c. treatment of mice infected intracerebrally with the Balliet strain of PTV resulted in a moderate infection-inhibitory effect, seen especially by reduced virus titers in the brains of the infected, treated mice."
"The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene","The genetic variation of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) was estimated by sequencing a portion of the M segment RNA of 22 isolates from a variety of host species collected over 34 years in 6 African countries. The M segment RNA of the Egyptian isolate, ZH501, which has been molecularly cloned and sequenced, was used as a reference for these comparisons. Specific gene regions, responsible for antigenic determinants presumed to play a role in protection against disease, were emphasized in these investigations. Comparative sequence data revealed that most isolates were very similar to ZH501 at both the nucleic acid and deduced amino acid sequence levels. Nucleic acid sequence variation range was 0-4.5%. Amino acid sequence variation range was 0-2.4%. We identified specific amino acid coding changes which may be involved in virus neutralization and may contribute to the virulence characteristics of RVFV."
"Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Biological sciences","Members of the Bunyaviridae family of RNA viruses (bunyaviruses, hantaviruses, nairoviruses, phleboviruses and uukuviruses) have been studied at the molecular and genetic level to understand the basis of their evolution and infection in vertebrate and invertebrate (arthropod) hosts. With the exception of the hantaviruses, these viruses infect and are transmitted by a variety of blood-sucking arthropods (mosquitoes, phlebotomines, gnats, ticks, etc.). The viruses are responsible for infection of various vertebrate species, occasionally causing human disease, morbidity and mortality (e.g. Rift Valley fever, Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever, Korean haemorrhagic fever). Genetic and molecular analyses of bunyaviruses have established the coding assignments of the three viral RNA species and documented which viral gene products determine host range and virulence. Ecological studies, with molecular techniques, have provided evidence for bunyavirus evolution in nature through genetic drift (involving the accumulation of point mutations) and shift (RNA-segment reassortment)."
"Microbial pathogenesis","Rift Valley fever viral strains or variants (RVFV) were compared with respect to (a) virulence for Wistar-Furth rats; (b) in vitro sensitivity to rat and human interferon; (c) ability to form plaques in primary hepatocyte cultures from genetically resistant or susceptible rat strains, and (d) replicative potential in continuous rat cell lines. Egyptian strains were highly virulent for Wistar-Furth rats; relatively resistant to rat interferon-alpha/beta; capable of producing plaques in primary hepatocyte monolayers; and, in general, replicated more rapidly than the low-virulent, sub-Saharan strains. Virtually all strains from sub-Saharan Africa were sensitive to rat interferon and did not form plaques in rat hepatocyte monolayers. An exception was the 2269/74 strain from Zimbabwe, which had characteristics of the Egyptian strains including increased virulence for Wistar-Furth rats. The relative virulence of RVFV strains for rats did not correlate with interferon sensitivity when human recombinant interferon-alpha was tested on A-549 cells. Thus, several in vitro phenotypic characteristics of RVFV strains tend to correlate with virulence for Wistar-Furth rats and with geographical origin of the viral strains."
"Annales de l'Institut Pasteur. Virology","A total of 1,715 randomly selected sheep and goat sera from Senegal were tested for antibodies against Rift Valley fever virus using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The results showed that Rift Valley fever is enzootic. The prevalence is highly heterogeneous, depending on the area. Sheep and goats expressed comparable antibody prevalence, suggesting that both are involved equally in the virus cycle."
"Journal of clinical microbiology","A solid-phase immunosorbent technique (SPIT) was adapted to detect Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus-specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) in serum samples from humans vaccinated with Formalin-inactivated RVF vaccine. Microdilution plates coated with goat anti-human IgM were successively incubated with serum samples from human vaccinees, RVF virus hemagglutinating antigen, and goose erythrocytes. The RVF virus-specific IgM in the serum samples from vaccinees bound to the RVF virus antigen and inhibited hemagglutination of goose erythrocytes. SPIT was compared to the IgM capture enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the indirect immunofluorescent-antibody (IFA) assay and was found to be sensitive in detecting RVF virus-specific IgM antibody, with high correlations between SPIT and the other two tests (Pearson's correlation coefficient [r] = 0.9 and 0.6, respectively). Results of SPIT were obtained within 5 h, offering speed over ELISA (8 h). In addition, SPIT does not require sophisticated equipment or expensive reagents. Serum rheumatoid factor did not produce false-positive reactions in SPIT as in the indirect immunofluorescent-antibody assay and IgM capture ELISA."
"Virology","The Phlebovirus Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), like other members of the Bunyaviridae family, matures intracellularly at the smooth-surfaced vesicles in the Golgi region of infected cells. Here we show that in cultured cells the RVFV glycoproteins G2 and G1 accumulate and are retained at this site. To investigate the parameters governing this subcellular localization, we have engineered portions of the cloned RVFV M segment (which encodes a 14- and a 78-kDa protein, in addition to glycoproteins G2 and G1) into vaccinia virus. Immunofluorescent analysis of cells infected with a vaccinia virus recombinant containing the entire open reading frame of the RVFV M segment revealed Golgi localization for glycoproteins G2, G1, the 78-kDa protein, and Golgi as well as some reticular distribution for the 14-kDa protein. These distributions paralleled those seen in authentic RVFV-infected cells. RVFV-vaccinia virus recombinants possessing progressive deletions within the 152 amino acid preglycoprotein sequence of the M segment were analyzed for possible effects on the cellular distribution of G2 and G1. Removal of the first 130 amino acids of the open reading frame amino-terminal to the mature glycoprotein coding sequences, while abolishing production of the 78- and 14-kDa proteins, did not alter the Golgi location of G2 and G1. The data suggest that Golgi-specific signals reside within the G2 and/or G1 glycoprotein sequences. The use of vaccinia virus recombinants provides a genetically manipulable expression system with which to further investigate the sequences involved in the intracellular localization of these Phlebovirus proteins."
"The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene","Distribution of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) was studied in the mosquito Culex pipiens. Mosquitoes were dissected on days 1-7 after an infectious bloodmeal, and RVFV plaque assays were performed on the legs, posterior midgut, ovaries, salivary glands, thoracic ganglia, and remaining organs and tissues (remnants). On days 7-12 and 14 following an infectious bloodmeal, mosquitoes were tested for their ability to transmit virus and then dissected. Dissemination (systemic infection) rates averaged 22% on days 1-14 and transmission rates 33% on days 7-14. There were no significant differences in the viral titers of midgut samples among the nondisseminated infected (virus limited to alimentary canal), disseminated infected nontransmitting, and transmitting groups of mosquitoes. The sequence of infection of the organs and tissues studied appeared to be as follows: midgut, hemolymph, remnants: salivary glands, ovaries, and thoracic ganglia. Some individuals were found to have disseminated infections as early as 12 hr following an infectious bloodmeal. Trauma, simulated by vigorous shaking immediately following the viremic bloodmeal, did not affect either infection or dissemination rates."
"The Journal of tropical medicine and hygiene","From October 1985 through November 1986, 1714 presumably unvaccinated sheep in 13 nomadic flocks located in four provinces in Dakahliya Governorate, in the northeast Nile Delta, were ear tagged and monitored for acquisition of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) antibodies. Sheep were bled at approximately 3 month intervals and sera were tested for haemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibodies to RVFV. HI reactors were tested for RVFV specific IgM antibody by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and neutralizing antibody to RVFV by plaque reduction neutralization (PRN) tests. Base line results showed 1.2% prevalence of HI antibody to RVFV with titres from 1:20 to 1:320. All HI positive sera were PRN positive through PRN titres were generally higher than HI titres. No RVFV specific IgM antibody was detected in the HI and PRN positive sera. Throughout the study, no initially seronegative sheep became positive and no HI positive sheep showed an appreciable increase above initial antibody titre. These data indicate absence of RVFV transmission to sheep in Dakahliya Governorate during the period of the study."

"Virology","A cell-free system has been used to study gene expression of the M segment RNA of the Phlebovirus Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV). RVFV sequence-containing plasmids were used to synthesize M segment mRNA-like transcripts. These transcripts were then translated in vitro in the absence or presence of microsomal membranes. Cell-free translation of a transcript which closely resembled authentic M segment mRNA (RNA-7) yielded a primary translation product of 133 kilodaltons (kDa), the size expected of a polypeptide encompassing the entire open reading frame (ORF) of the M segment. When translations were conducted in the presence of microsomal membranes, this primary protein was cotranslationally processed to yield the two viral glycoproteins, G1 and G2, as well as proteins of 78, 21, and 14 kDa. With one exception, these in vitro processed polypeptides comigrated with M segment-encoded proteins found in RVFV-infected cell lysates. A polypeptide corresponding to the in vitro 21-kDa protein was not detected in vivo. To investigate translational initiation and processing of the protein products of the M segment, additional transcripts were generated in which varying portions of the amino-terminal ""preglycoprotein"" region of the M segment ORF were deleted. Translation results indicated that the 78- and 21-kDa proteins were initiated from the first methionine codon of the ORF, and the 14-kDa polypeptide began from the second in-phase ATG. These products and a major portion of the preglycoprotein region sequence were not required for the proper synthesis and processing of the viral glycoproteins in vitro. In light of these results, possible expression strategies used by this Phlebovirus M segment RNA are discussed."
"Infection","Liposomes are microscopic, closed lipid vesicles able to entrap hydrophilic as well as lipophilic compounds. They constitute a versatile drug delivery system. When injected by the intravenous route, liposomes are taken up by macrophages in the liver and in the spleen. Investigation of several animal models of infections has shown that liposome-entrapped anti-infectious drugs are active against infections due to facultative intracellular bacteria, parasites such as Leishmania, viruses such as the one causing Rift valley fever. Liposomes of different lipid compositions, structures and sizes were used for intravenous administration of anti-infectious drugs without inducing toxicity in the tested animals. Clinical experience was obtained with two different liposomal preparations of amphotericin B in the treatment of systemic fungal diseases in cancer patients; these preparations were shown to be effective and very well-tolerated."

"The Journal of general virology","The wild-type ZH501 strain of Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus and two small-plaque strains (T1 and T46) derived from it were characterized by plaque size, pathogenicity for hamsters and ability to replicate in Vero cells. Additionally, a mutagenized, attenuated, large-plaque, vaccine-candidate strain of RVF virus (ZH548-M12) was also studied. Infections with either the ZH501 or T46 strain were uniformly fatal to hamsters. In contrast, nearly all hamsters infected with either the T1 or ZH548-M12 strains survived and were immune to challenge with 10(5) LD50 of the ZH501 strain. Both of these attenuated strains failed to replicate in Vero cells maintained at 41 degrees C, whereas the more virulent strains (ZH501 and T46) replicated at this temperature. The low virulence and ability to induce protection against lethal RVF virus challenge that is associated with the T1 and ZH548-M12 strains make them potential vaccine candidates."
"Journal of virology","Recombinant vaccinia viruses were constructed and used in conjunction with site-specific antisera to study the coding capacity and detailed expression strategy of the M segment of the Phlebovirus Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV). The M segment could be completely and faithfully expressed in recombinant RVFV-vaccinia virus-infected cells, the gene products apparently being correctly processed and modified in the absence of the RVFV L and S genomic segments. The proteins encoded by the RVFV M segment included, in addition to the viral glycoproteins G2 and G1, two previously uncharacterized polypeptides of 78 and 14 kilodaltons (kDa). By manipulation of RVFV sequences present in the recombinant vaccinia viruses and use of specific antibody reagents, it was found that the 78-kDa protein initiated at the first initiation codon of the open reading frame and encompassed the entire preglycoprotein and glycoprotein G2 coding sequences. The 14-kDa protein appeared to begin from the second in-phase ATG and was composed of only the preglycoprotein sequences. Both viral glycoproteins G2 and G1 could be synthesized and correctly processed in the absence of the 78- and 14-kDa proteins, as well as a large portion of the preglycoprotein sequences. However, the hydrophobic amino acid sequence immediately preceding the mature glycoprotein coding sequences was required for authentic glycoprotein production. The M-segment expression strategy involving aspects of translational initiation and protein processing are discussed. The functional roles of the 78- and 14-kDa proteins remain unclear."

"Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy","Ribavirin (1-beta-D-ribofuranosyl-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide) was markedly inhibitory in vitro to Adames and Balliet strains of Punta Toro virus (PTV), a Phlebovirus related to Rift Valley fever and sandfly fever viruses. By using inhibition of viral cytopathic effect in LLC-MK2 cells with both virus strains, the 50% effective dose was 4 to 10 micrograms/ml and the virus rating was 1.3. The Adames strain of PTV infection in mice was established for evaluation of the in vivo antiviral efficacy of ribavirin. The drug was administered subcutaneously (s.c.) twice daily for 5 to 7 days beginning 4 h pre-virus inoculation, 24 h post-virus inoculation, or 36 h post-virus inoculation, with increased survivors, reduced hepatic icterus, reduction of serum glutamic oxalic acid transaminase and serum glutamic pyruvic acid transaminase, and inhibition of infectious virus from sera and livers of infected mice. The minimum effective dose was 4.7 mg/kg per day, with a maximum tolerated dose of 75 mg/kg per day. When the same treatment schedule beginning 4 h pre-virus inoculation, 4 h post-virus inoculation, or 24 h post-virus inoculation was used, orally administered ribavirin was effective at doses as low as 6.3 mg/kg per day. Single s.c. ribavirin treatments at doses of 175 to 700 mg/kg administered from 4 to 48 h post-virus inoculation were also effective. No effect was seen when ribavirin was administered s.c. to mice infected intracerebrally with the PTV strain Balliet, even though treatment was begun 36 h before virus exposure."
"The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene","Using the immunofluorescence test, a serosurvey for antibodies to five viral agents associated with hemorrhagic febrile infections was conducted with 1,677 human sera from different parts of Nigeria. Three hundred fifty-seven (21.3%) were positive for Lassa virus antibody, while antibodies to Rift Valley fever virus were detected in 42 (2.5%) of the sera. Testing for Rift Valley fever virus antibody was confirmed by plaque reduction neutralization test. Antibodies to Ebola and Marburg viruses were detected in 30 and 29 sera, respectively. Of the 357 Lassa virus antibody-positive sera, 297 (83.2%) were positive for Lassa only. In contrast, sera positive for Marburg were positive in combination with Lassa, Ebola, or Rift Valley fever viruses.

"Journal of the American Mosquito Control Association","Aedes juppi was readily infected by inoculation with virus but failed to transmit either horizontally or vertically. Seventy-five to 90% of the other 4 mosquito species became infected after ingesting 6.8-9.8 log10CPD50/ml of virus. These species all transmitted virus at the following rates on the post-infection days indicated: Aedes unidentatus (58%--day 11), Aedes dentatus (32%--day 11, 50%--day 18), Culex poicilipes (15%--day 15, 80%--day 30) and Aedes argenteopunctatus (14% on day 30). On the basis of these results and the relative prevalence of each species, it was concluded that Ae. unidentatus and Ae. dentatus are potential epizootic and possibly reservoir vectors and Cx. poicilipes a potential epizootic vector of Rift Valley fever virus in South Africa."
"The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene","Selected North American mosquito species were evaluated as potential vectors of Rift Valley fever virus. Field populations of Aedes canadensis, Ae. cantator, Ae. excrucians, Ae. sollicitans, Ae. taeniorhynchus, Ae. triseriatus, Anopheles bradleyi-crucians, Culex salinarius, Cx. tarsalis, and Cx. territans perorally exposed to 10(6.2)-10(7.2) plaque forming units of Rift Valley fever virus readily became infected. Infection rates ranged from 51% (65/127) for Cx. salinarius to 96% (64/67) for Ae. canadensis. Disseminated infection rates were generally greater at 14 days than at 7 days after the infectious bloodmeal, and, with the exception of An. bradleyi-crucians, they were not significantly different than the pooled rate of 59% for each species tested. Only 5/55 (9%) of the An. bradleyi-crucians developed a disseminated infection. For most of the species, about half of the mosquitoes with a disseminated infection transmitted an infectious dose of virus to hamsters. While all species, with the exception of An. bradleyi-crucians, transmitted virus, Ae. canadensis, Ae. taeniorhynchus, and Cx. tarsalis had the highest vector potential of the species tested. Following inoculation of approximately 10(1.6) plaque forming units of virus, 100% of the mosquitoes of each species became infected. For most species, transmission rates were similar for inoculated individuals and those that developed a disseminated infection following peroral infection. Viral titers of transmitting and nontransmitting-disseminated individuals were similar for all species tested. These data suggest that, if Rift Valley fever virus was introduced into North America, several mosquito species would be capable of transmitting it."
"Journal of medical virology","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) grown in vero cell cultures has a completed replication cycle within 13 hours. The first signs are the appearance of intranuclear fibrillar rods, followed by aggregations of precursor viral material in host cell cytoplasm and viral nucleocapsids budding into vacuoles associated with the Golgi apparati. Mature particles, liberated by the disintegration of vero cells, contained ribosomelike structures within the nucleocapsid, which was surrounded by a typical unit membrane through which were inserted some 350-375 surface spikes whose inner ends were incorporated into the nucleocapsid structure. In the negatively stained material, the overall diameter of the virion was 90-110 nm; the spikes were 10-18 nm in length and 5 nm in diameter."
"Archives of virology","Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a major cause of human morbidity and mortality in endemic areas of sub-Saharan Africa and has the potential to cause epidemic disease in receptive areas world-wide. In this study, a RVF viral isolate from the 1977 Egyptian epidemic (ZH-501) inoculated intravenously into rhesus macaques caused a benign viremic infection in most, but resulted in the hemorrhagic fever syndrome in 20 per cent (3 of 15). Serious disease of this type has not previously been observed in nonhuman primates inoculated with RVF virus and may be a consequence of the viral strain used or the route of inoculation. Severe disease was accompanied by extensive liver necrosis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. We also attempted to prevent RVF by passive transfer of serum from vaccinated rhesus monkeys (plaque-reduction neutralization test titer 1:2,560). As little as 0.025 ml/kg prevented the development of viremia in naive rhesus monkeys after subcutaneous inoculation of virus. The monkey model should be helpful in understanding the pathogenesis and prevention of human RVF."

Resistance to necrotizing encephalitis was age-dependent with 100% mortality at 3 weeks, decreasing to approximately 20% by 10 weeks of age in outbred gerbils inoculated subcutaneously. Fatal encephalitis in the 10-week-old adults was dose-independent [1.0-7.0 log10 plaque forming units (PFU), subcutaneously]. Viral replication and histological lesions were followed serially throughout the course of the infection in young (4 week) and adult (10 week) gerbils. Viral replication was evident in the brain tissue of young gerbils from day 4 (3.0 log10 PFU/g) through day 7 (6.0 log10 PFU/g), the last day the young gerbils survived. Virus was only detected in the brain tissue of a single adult gerbil (day 7, 4.0 log10 PFU/g) of 26 studied in the sequential survey. In contrast, two moribund adult gerbils had approximately 7.0 log10 PFU/g of virus in the brain tissue on days 8 and 11. When young and adult gerbils were inoculated with a low dose (50 PFU) of virus intracranially, there were no detectable differences in the course of infection with all animals succumbing to fatal necrotizing encephalitis approximately 7 days postinoculation.

However, in contrast to that has been observed in other cell types, RVFV replication in hepatocytes is associated with maturation at cellular surface membranes in addition to the smooth internal membranes of the Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum. Envelope acquisition at surface membranes occurred primarily on basolateral membranes. The events occurring in RVFV morphogenesis were indistinguishable in hepatocytes from resistant and susceptible animals; however, hepatocytes from susceptible animals produced significantly higher titers of virus."
"Journal of medical virology","Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus is a cause of significant human and animal disease in many parts of Africa. In some cases, it causes a hemorrhagic fever, which is frequently fatal. Prior studies have shown that RVF virus productively infects peritoneal macrophages from susceptible rat strains. The U937 human monocytic cell line was used to determine the effect of monocytic cell differentiation on the degree of viral production by cell cultures infected with RVF virus. Differentiation of U937 cells to more mature monocytic cells by phorbol ester resulted in production of 10 times more infectious virions in comparison with undifferentiated cells. These studies imply that monocytic cell differentiation increases permissiveness for RVF virus production."

Mothers experiencing fetal death or miscarriage (155) had the same RVF virus antibody prevalence as those with normal deliveries. Analysis of maternity histories showed some indication of increased fetal wastage among women positive for RVF virus antibody.

"The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene","The effect of Rift Valley fever (RVF) viral infection on the survival of female Culex pipiens was examined. In 3 experiments in which mosquitoes ingested RVF virus, there was a 44% decrease in survival to days 14-16 for transmitting vs. nontransmitting mosquitoes, and a 48% decrease in survival for individuals with disseminated vs. nondisseminated infections. These results were corroborated by other experiments in which survival of mosquitoes intrathoracically inoculated with RVF virus was compared with that of those inoculated with diluent. In both the per os and inoculation tests, uninfected mosquitoes survived significantly longer than infected mosquitoes. Even though mosquitoes with disseminated infections had a lower survival rate than did uninfected mosquitoes, dissemination and transmission rates were similar at days 7 and 14-18 after the infectious bloodmeal. This suggests that nondisseminated individuals were developing disseminated infections and becoming capable of transmitting virus between days 7 and 14-18 at approximately the same rate older transmitters were dying. The decreased survival associated with RVF viral infection should be considered in predictive models of this disease."
"Virology","We have determined the complete nucleotide sequence of the virion M RNA segment of Uukuniemi virus (Uukuvirus genus, Bunyaviridae) from cloned cDNA. The RNA that encodes the two membrane glycoproteins G1 and G2 is 3231 residues long (mol wt 1.1 X 10(6)). The 5' and 3' ends of the RNA are partially complementary to each other for some 30 bp, enabling the formation of a stable panhandle structure (delta G = -40 kcal/mol) and the circularization of the molecule. The extreme 5' and 3' terminal nucleotides are identical for 10 to 13 residues to those of the M RNA of Punta Toro and Rift Valley fever viruses, two members of the Phlebovirus genus. A single open reading frame comprising 1008 amino acid residues (mol wt 113,588) was found in the mRNA-sense strand between nucleotides 18 and 3042. This probably corresponds to the previously identified 110,000-Da precursor (p110) of G1 and G2. By comparing the partial aminoterminal sequences of purified G1 and G2 with the deduced protein sequence we confirmed that the gene order is NH2-G1-G2-COOH. Both mature G1 and G2 are preceded by a stretch of 17 predominantly hydrophobic amino acids likely to represent the signal sequences. At their COOH-terminal ends, G1 and G2 have a hydrophobic stretch of amino acids, 19 and 27 residues, respectively, that probably anchors the proteins to the lipid bilayer. The sequence indicates that mature G2 is 495 amino acids long (mol wt 54,869), whereas the exact size of G1 is unclear, since the location of the COOH-terminus of G1 is not known. An upper value of 479 amino acids (mol wt 55,181) can, however, be suggested. Both G1 and G2 contain four potential glycosylation sites for Asn-linked glycans and both are unusually rich in cysteines, 6.1% in G1 and 5.4% in G2. Comparison of the amino acid sequence of the M RNA product of Uukuniemi virus with that of Punta Toro and Rift Valley fever viruses showed in both cases a weak homology that was more pronounced for the proteins located at the COOH-terminal end of the precursor. This suggests a distant evolutionary relationship between the Phlebo- and Uukuvirus genera."
"Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy","The prophylactic efficacy of poly(ICLC) (stabilized, synthetic, double-stranded polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic acid) against Rift Valley fever virus infection in Swiss-Webster mice was dependent on the treatment schedule. The treatment schedule was optimized by ranking the results of various treatments by the Cox proportional-hazard model based on the incremental relative risk of death. With this ranking procedure, the schedule of choice was three doses of 20 micrograms each given 5 days apart. This regimen yielded a 90% survival rate. Additional parameters were determined, including the timing of the first and second drug dose, the temporal relationship of these treatments to the day of challenge, and the minimal effective dose (1 microgram per mouse)."

"Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy","The therapeutic efficacy of polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic acid stabilized with poly-L-lysine and carboxymethyl cellulose [poly(ICLC)] given alone or in combination with ribavirin was evaluated in Swiss Webster mice infected with Rift Valley fever virus. Four or more 20-micrograms doses of poly(ICLC) given at various intervals beginning 24 h after infection protected all mice against death. On the other hand, a treatment regimen consisting of only three doses of poly(ICLC) given 24 h postinfection resulted in a 50% survival rate. When initiated 48 h postinfection, an extended treatment regimen with the same dose was required to yield 40% survivors. Lower doses (5 micrograms) of poly(ICLC) per mouse were only marginally effective even when six injections were given between days 1 and 9 postinfection. The combined administration of ribavirin and poly(ICLC) initiated as late as 48 h postinfection was effective even when treatment consisted of doses that were ineffective when either drug was used alone."
"American journal of veterinary research","An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed for the rapid detection of antibodies to Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) in ovine and bovine sera. Conditions to reduce nonspecific reactions were optimized. The ELISA results correlated with those of a plaque-reduction neutralization test, revealing 100% specificity and 90.7% sensitivity. In sera from sheep and cattle inoculated against RVFV, the hemagglutination-inhibition test in combination with the ELISA provided a better indication of response to killed RVFV vaccine than did either test alone."
"American journal of veterinary research","A mutagenized clone of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV; MV P12) used in inoculation of 3 pregnant ewes was immunogenic, nonpathogenic, and nonabortogenic. In contrast, inoculation of a matched group of 3 pregnant ewes with parent RVFV induced clinical disease and abortions. Ewes given MV P12 delivered healthy lambs that had RVFV antibody titers of less than 1:10 at birth, increasing to greater than or equal to 1:80 after ingestion of colostrum. Ewes inoculated with parent RVFV developed marked viremia, followed by RVFV antibody titers greater than or equal to 1:1,280; ewes inoculated with MV P12 developed low viremia titers and RVFV antibody titers of 1:80 to 1:320. Postpartum challenge exposure of the previously MV P12-inoculated ewes with virulent Zagazig human 501 strain RVFV indicated that the ewes were protected from clinical disease. The RVFV-susceptible female Culex pipiens that fed on the MV P12-inoculated ewes failed to transmit RVFV to hamsters; mosquitoes that fed on the parent RVFV-inoculated ewes became infected and transmitted RVFV to hamsters."

"Microbial pathogenesis","The pathogenesis of Rift Valley fever in adult rats from 3 inbred strains (LEW, MAXX, WF) was investigated. WF rats all died by day 2 postinoculation with viral tissue titers reaching 9 log10 PFU/g. LEW and MAXX rats were resistant to liver disease, but fatal necrotising encephalitis developed in 16 and 44% of the rats, respectively. Detection of serum neutralising antibody on day 3 coincided with clearance of virus from serum and liver, although infectious virus was detected in spleen homogenates as late as day 19 postinfection. Viral titers in LEW and MAXX rats did not exceed 4.5 log10 PFU/g. Cyclophosphamide immunosuppression of LEW rats led to death 5-9 days postinfection; early patterns of viral replication were not affected, but continued growth in the liver resulted in fatal hepatitis. These animals could be protected by passive antibody therapy administered on days 2-5 postinfection to mimic the serum neutralising antibody pattern seen in unmanipulated infected LEW rats. Thus, RVF virus replication and spread is rapid in the WF rats tissues, whereas in LEW and MAXX rats viral growth is less due to an intrinsic mechanism which allows sufficient time for an immune response to terminate infection. A slightly diminished immune response may lead to the development of encephalitis more frequently in MAXX than LEW rats. These rat strains should be useful in elucidating those mechanisms of resistance which limit RVFV-induced hepatitis and encephalitis."
"Science (New York, N.Y.)","Data from the advanced very high resolution radiometer on board the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's polar-orbiting meteorological satellites have been used to infer ecological parameters associated with Rift Valley fever (RVF) viral activity in Kenya. An indicator of potential viral activity was produced from satellite data for two different ecological regions in Kenya, where RVF is enzootic. The correlation between the satellite-derived green vegetation index and the ecological parameters associated with RVF virus suggested that satellite data may become a forecasting tool for RVF in Kenya and, perhaps, in other areas of sub-Saharan Africa."

"Bulletin de la Société de pathologie exotique et de ses filiales","During the years 1984-1985, 1,528 serum samples were taken through out the CAR. Of these sera, 319 (20.8%) contained anti-Filoviridae antibodies (Ebola, Marburg). This figure is higher than those found in Cameroon, Sudan, Gabon and Zaïre. Three zones of the country are particularly exposed, the North-East where the population is in the contact with Sudan Ebola, the South-East where it is in contact with Zaïre Ebola, and the South-West where it is in contact with Sudan Ebola. The authors believe that there could exist either a Central African Ebola strain or an Ebola-Like less pathogenic virus which is responsible for cross reactions. Results concerning Rift Valley Fever virus, Congo virus and Lassa virus seem less interesting. However RVF and Congo strains were isolated."

"Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene","4 Egyptian mosquito species were tested for their ability to transmit the Egyptian ZH-501 strain of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) to golden Syrian hamsters. Culex (Cx.) antennatus was the most efficient vector, showing a 37.5% transmission rate following a hamster blood meal containing 10 suckling mouse intracerebral 50% lethal doses (SMILD50) per ml. Fully engorged mosquitoes of this species showed an infection rate of 85% with the mean viral titres of transmitting mosquitoes 100-fold higher than non-transmitters. Autogenous and anautogenous populations of Aedes (Ae.) caspius were tested separately, and the transmission rates were 23.1% and 9.7% respectively, following feeding on hamsters with similar levels of viraemia. Two anopheline species, Anopheles (An.) multicolor and An. pharoensis, showed 12.5% and 3.5% transmission rates under similar conditions. In these 3 species infection rates exceeded 75% and mosquitoes transmitting had a higher average titre than those not transmitting."

"The Journal of tropical medicine and hygiene","Rift Valley fever (RVF), which was enzootic in Sudan in 1976 and epidemic in Egypt in 1977-78, may have been introduced into Egypt from Sudan via sheep transported along Lake Nasser. A hypothesis is presented which describes sheep transport from holding areas in north-central Sudan, where RVF was epizootic, to live animal markets in southern Egypt. Travel time from north-central Sudan to the Aswan area was less than 5 days, approximating the incubation period of RVF virus in sheep. Reintroduction of RVF or other diseases from Sudan into Egypt will be facilitated by the construction of new roads linking the two countries."
"The Journal of hygiene","Homologous and heterologous haemagglutination-inhibition (HAI), complement-fixation (CF), immunodiffusion (ID) and mouse neutralization tests were performed with the Lunyo (LUN) and a Zimbabwean strain of Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus, the prototype and a South African strain of Arumowot (AMT) virus and prototype strains of Gordil (GOR), Saint-Floris (SAF) and Gabek Forest (GF) viruses, using immune mouse ascitic fluids prepared against these viruses. Reactions of identity occurred in all tests between LUN and the Zimbabwean strains of RVF and between the two strains of AMT virus. Otherwise, cross-reactions occurred between all the phleboviruses in HAI tests, while reactions in CF, ID and neutralization tests were monospecific for virus serotypes, except that weak cross-reaction occurred between GOR and SAF viruses in CF and ID tests. Four sheep infected subcutaneously with the Zimbabwean strain of RVF virus developed transient fever, viraemia, leucopaenia, relative thrombocytopaenia, haemoconcentration and raised serum enzyme levels, which indicated that the sheep had developed necrotic hepatitis. Disseminated focal necrotic hepatitis was confirmed in a sheep killed for examination on day 4 post-infection. The other three sheep recovered uneventfully after only mild depression and anorexia. Groups of three sheep infected with SAF, GOR, AMT and GF viruses had no demonstrable viraemia or other sign of infection or illness, except that the sheep infected with AMT developed mild fever lasting less than 24 h. Antibody responses were monitored at intervals over a period of 24 weeks in all sheep by homologous and heterologous HAI, CF and cell culture neutralization (CPENT) tests. Homologous antibody responses were marked in the RVF-infected sheep and their sera cross-reacted strongly in HAI tests with antigens of the other viruses. The sera of the RVF-infected sheep cross-reacted less markedly in CF and CPENT tests. Homologous antibody responses were poor in all the sheep infected with phleboviruses other than RVF, and the cross-reactivity of their sera for RVF antigen or virus was negligible. All sheep were challenged with RVF virus 48 weeks after their initial infection. The sheep which had originally been infected with RVF virus were immune and developed neither fever nor viraemia. All other sheep developed fever, viraemia and antibodies to RVF virus. It was concluded that the African phleboviruses, other than RVF, are unlikely to cause disease in livestock or to induce antibodies which could cause confusion in the diagnosis of RVF."
"The Journal of hygiene","Nine serological techniques were compared by monitoring the response to infection with Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus in three sheep. Antibodies were monitored daily for the first 14 days after infection, then weekly and later fortnightly up to week 24. The earliest antibody response was detected in one sheep on day 3 by a plaque reduction neutralization test, and by day 6 antibodies were demonstrable in all three sheep by haemagglutination-inhibition, reversed passive haemagglutination-inhibition, immunodiffusion, indirect immunofluorescence (IF), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and neutralization of cytopathic effect in cell cultures. Antibodies were demonstrable by complement fixation on day 8 at the earliest. IF and the two neutralization techniques produced the highest titres, but all tests could be used satisfactorily for the serological diagnosis of RVF. Inactivated antigen could be used for all except the neutralization tests. A radioimmunoassay technique using 125I-labelled staphylococcal protein A detected antibodies on day 8 at the earliest and produced lower mean titres than some of the other techniques. This was probably because sheep immunoglobulins bind protein A poorly."
"Journal of clinical microbiology","To determine the accuracy of serological methods in detecting Rift Valley fever (RVF) viral antibodies, we examined serum samples obtained from 418 sheep in the Nile Delta by using five tests. The plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) was considered the standard serological method against which the four other tests were compared. Twenty-four serum samples had RVF viral antibodies detected by PRNT. Hemagglutination inhibition and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay antibodies to RVF virus were also present in the same 24 serum samples. Indirect immunofluorescence was less sensitive in comparison with PRNT, and complement fixation was the least sensitive. These results extend observations made with laboratory animals to a large field-collected group of Egyptian sheep."

"The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene","Rift Valley fever (RVF) surveillance was carried out in the Nile Delta by monitoring mobile and stationary sheep flocks for antibodies to RVF virus. Sheep are known to be susceptible to RVF virus infection and experienced severe morbidity in 1977 and 1978 when RVF was epidemic in Egypt. Four hundred six sheep in 32 flocks were surveyed during 1984. Twenty-four sheep from 7 flocks had antibodies to RVF virus detected by hemagglutination inhibition and plaque reduction neutralization tests. Antibodies were found primarily in sheep greater than 3 years of age, although 1- and 2-year-old sheep were included in the sample. No seroconversion was observed among 177 seronegative sheep that were bled successively for a period of 10 months. These results indicate that epizootic RVF was probably not present in the Nile Delta during 1984."
"The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene","The avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (ABC) immunocytochemical procedure was used to locate Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus antigen in infected Aedes albopictus C6/36 cultured cells and in serial paraffin sections of intrathoracically-injected Egyptian Culex pipiens. Fixation of the cultured cells in formaldehyde or periodate-lysine-paraformaldehyde, and fixation of whole mosquitoes with formaldehyde resulted in good preservation of morphology and excellent differential staining between uninfected and infected specimens. Two primary antibodies against RVF virus were tested on the cultured cells: a polyclonal rabbit antiserum and a mixture of mouse monoclonal antibodies. Only the mouse monoclonal antibody mixture was tested on the Cx. pipiens. Specific staining of tissues in paraffin sections occurred at dilutions as high as 1:5,000. In both cultured Ae. albopictus cells and sections of Cx. pipiens, only the cytoplasm was positive for antigen. A preliminary list of tissues in Cx. pipiens that exhibited specific or nonspecific staining is given."
"Vaccine","A formalin-inactivated Rift Valley fever vaccine prepared in primary monkey kidney cells has been used to protect laboratory workers from disease since 1967. A similar but improved vaccine was prepared in 1978-1979 using well characterized diploid fetal rhesus lung cells. In initial clinical trials reported here, the new vaccine elicited high levels of plaque neutralizing antibodies and caused only minimal local reactions at the injection site. Significant variability was observed in the geometric mean titre evoked by various vaccine lots. This variability had not been predicted by conventional pre-filtration or pre-inactivation virus infectivity assays, or the results of animal potency tests. These findings emphasize the need for statistically valid human potency testing and the development of accurate predictive preclinical measurements for this and other vaccines."
"Tropical and geographical medicine","Serum samples from 119 healthy individuals and 106 epilepsy patients inhabiting Grand Bassa County, Liberia, were tested for antibodies to hemorrhagic fever viruses (HFV) by indirect immunofluorescence. E6 Vero cells infected with Lassa fever virus (LAS), Rift Valley Fever virus (RVF), Congo Hemorrhagic Fever virus (CON), Marburg virus (MBG) and the Ebola (EBO) virus strains Mayinga (May) and Boniface (Bon) were used as antigen. To obtain reproducible and specific test results sera had to be absorbed extensively with uninfected E6 Vero cells, tested for reactivity to both virus infected and uninfected E6 Vero cells and read ""blindly"" by two independent observers. Antibodies to EBO were shown to be highly prevalent (13.4%) in the population of this rainforest area, while prevalences of antibodies to LAS (1.3%), RVF (0.4%) and MBG (1.3%) were much lower. No correlation between past HFV infection and post-encephalitic epilepsy or other reported febrile illnesses could be established."
"Antiviral research","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), a member of the family Bunyaviridae, extended its range from sub-Saharan Africa into Egypt in 1977. Its clinical spectrum is recognized to include severe manifestations such as hemorrhagic fever and encephalitis. For these reasons, as well as the limited knowledge of specific therapy for Bunyaviridae infections, we investigated several prophylactic regimens for RVF in a mouse model. Rimantadine, thiosemicarbazone, and inosiplex were ineffective. Pretreatment with glucan was of some use, but the most encouraging results were obtained with the antiviral drug ribavirin, passive antibody, or an interferon inducer polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic acid complexed with poly-L-lysine and carboxymethylcellulose (poly[ICLC]). Ribavirin and poly(ICLC) were also shown to be efficacious in preventing disease in hamsters. Ribavirin (loading dose of 50 mg/kg followed by 10 mg/kg at 8-h intervals for 9 days) suppressed viremia in RVF-infected rhesus monkeys. Ribavirin also reduced virus yield in infected cell cultures; sensitivity varied markedly with cell type but not with virus strain. Immune mouse ascitic fluid, with a plaque reduction neutralization titer of 1:1024, was effective in a dose of 4 ml/kg, a volume approximately equivalent to administration of a unit of convalescent plasma to a human. Poly(ICLC) may well have functioned through interferon induction, since RVFV was shown to be sensitive to interferon in cell culture, and since another macrophage activator (glucan) was only marginally effective. These studies suggest that ribavirin, poly(ICLC), and convalescent plasma may have a role in prevention or therapy of human RVF."

"The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene","The injection of a single dose containing 5 X 10(3) plaque forming units (PFU) of a minute plaque variant of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) into two susceptible lambs resulted in no detectable viremia, pyrexia or clinical signs of disease. Immunization with the minute plaque variant induced neutralizing antibody as early as seven days postinoculation; however, no complement fixing antibodies were detected. Lambs immunized in this manner were protected when challenged with an infectious dose containing 1 X 10(3) PFU of wild type RVFV. These data indicate that the minute plaque variant may hold promise as a candidate live virus animal vaccine."
"Journal of virology","Four distinct antigenic determinants along the G2 glycoprotein encoded by the M segment RNA of the Phlebovirus Rift Valley fever virus were localized. These epitopes were defined by four monoclonal antibodies, three of which were capable of neutralizing virus infectivity; one was nonneutralizing. Immunoprecipitation by these monoclonal antibodies of either denatured or native antigen characterized the epitopes as having linear or higher order structure. Molecular cloning of G2 glycoprotein-coding sequences into a bacterial expression plasmid utilizing a beta-galactosidase fusion protein system was employed for epitope localization. A nuclease BAL 31 plasmid expression library, in which processive regions of the 3' end of the G2 glycoprotein coding sequences were deleted, allowed for approximation of the carboxy-terminal limit of the antigenic determinants. Further subcloning of limited G2 polypeptide sequences into the bacterial expression vector permitted more refined localization of the epitopes. The characteristics of the immunoreactivity of these small peptide regions (between 11 and 34 amino acids) produced in bacteria as G2-beta-galactosidase fusion proteins were similar to those of the authentic Rift Valley fever virus G2 glycoprotein. These defined antigenic determinants and their importance in virus infectivity are discussed."

"The Veterinary record","Epidemic Rift Valley fever is generally recognised when a higher than expected frequency of abortions and haemorrhages occurs in sheep and other livestock. Other infectious agents can cause similar clinical signs. In Egypt, an outbreak of abortions and haemorrhages in sheep and goats in 1982 was traced to intoxication with the rodenticide brodifacoum. The epidemic lasted for three weeks and resulted in 120 deaths. The end of the epidemic coincided with a heavy rainstorm. This outbreak demonstrates the need for the strict control of the use of rodenticides and widens the differential diagnosis of epidemic abortion in sheep and goats."

"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","The generalized hematopathology frequently found in animals infected with vector-borne pathogens may maximize transmission by enhancing the ability of vectors to locate blood in infected hosts. We tested this idea of mutualism between parasite and vector by comparing duration of probing of mosquitoes feeding on noninfected and on malaria-(Plasmodium chabaudi) or arbovirus-(Rift Valley fever virus) infected animals. We found that median duration of probing (blood location) on infected rodents was reduced by at least 1 min as compared to noninfected rodents. This enhanced ability of vectors to locate blood, possibly caused by parasite-disrupted hemostasis, may be a common feature of vector-borne diseases."
"The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene","Studies were conducted to examine the effects of extrinsic incubation (EI) temperature on the vector competence of Egyptian Culex pipiens and North American Aedes taeniorhynchus for Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus. Following per os exposure, infection rates in Ae. taeniorhynchus remained relatively constant at 55%, 56%, and 59% for mosquitoes held at EI temperatures of 13, 26, and 33 degrees C, respectively. In contrast, significantly fewer Cx. pipiens became infected when held at 13 degrees C (38%), than when held at 26 degrees C (75%) or 33 degrees C (91%). In both species, viral dissemination and transmission occurred earlier in mosquitoes held at high temperatures as compared to those held at low temperatures. Following EI at 26 or 33 degrees C, Cx. pipiens were able to transmit virus as early as 1 day after inoculation with RVF virus. However, 3 days were required before the first transmissions by inoculated Ae. taeniorhynchus. Temperature of EI affected these 2 species differently in their ability to transmit RVF virus. Because of the importance of EI temperature on infection and transmission rates, as well the length of the EI period, the role of EI temperature will need to be evaluated for each virus and vector pair."
"South African medical journal = Suid-Afrikaanse tydskrif vir geneeskunde","Sera from 124 cattle herds were tested, and antibodies to Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) were found in 93 herds.

Only 17 out of 1109 (1,5%) human residents of 55 farms had antibodies to CCHF, while none of 164 veterinary research workers or 98 veterinarians engaged in farm animal practice had them. Specimens from 130 suspected cases of viral haemorrhagic fever were examined and CCHF was diagnosed only in the patient previously reported as the first case of the disease to be recognized in this country. A further 2 cases of CCHF were diagnosed by examining 318 specimens from patients with nonfatal febrile illness. Both patients had contact with livestock. Increasing awareness of the disease will probably lead to an increase in the number of cases diagnosed, but there are no grounds for concluding that the disease is on the increase."

Prophylactically, the best effect was obtained with 2-3 doses of 1-20 micrograms poly(I,C)-LC, which fully protected the mice in a schedule-dependent fashion against an LD100 RVFV challenge. Multiple intermittent therapeutic administration of 20 micrograms poly(I,C)-LC 24 or 48 h after infection protected 100% and 50% of the mice, respectively. When given as late as 48 h after infection, 20 micrograms poly(I,C)-LC prevented viremia, and single or multiple doses induced high levels of serum interferon that peaked 24 h after administration of the compound. As late as 48 h postinfection, a high degree of therapeutic synergism was achieved with the combined administration of poly(I,C)-LC and the antiviral compound ribavirin, using doses that were not effective alone."
"Journal of medicinal chemistry","A number of 5-substituted imidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleosides were prepared and tested for their biological activity. Treatment of 5-chloro-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylimidazole-4-carboxamide (2) with methanethiol provided 5-(methylthio)-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylimidazole-4-carboxamide (3a). Similar treatment of 2 with ethanethiol or benzenemethanethiol gave the corresponding 5-ethylthio and 5-benzylthio derivatives 3b and 3c. Oxidation of 3a and 3b with m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid furnished the corresponding sulfonyl derivatives 4a and 4b. Reductive cleavage of 3c with sodium naphthalene or Na/NH3 gave 5-mercapto-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylimidazole-4-carboxamide (5-thiobredinin, 5). Direct treatment of 2 with sodium hydrosulfide provided an alternate route to 5, the structure of which was established by single-crystal X-ray analysis. 5-Thiobredinin has a zwitterionic structure similar to that of bredinin. Glycosylation of persilylated ethyl 5(4)-methylimidazole-4(5)-carboxylate (6) with 1-O-acetyl-2,3,5-tri-O-benzoyl-D-ribofuranose in the presence of SnCl4 provided a quantitative yield of the corresponding tri-O-benzoyl nucleoside 7. Debenzoylation of 7 with MeOH/NH3 at ambient temperature gave ethyl 5-methyl-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylimidazole-4-carboxylate (8). Further ammonolysis of 8 or 7 at elevated temperature and pressure gave 5-methyl-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylimidazole-4-carboxamide (9). All of these ribonucleosides were tested in Vero cell cultures and in mice against certain viruses. Compounds 3a and 3c exhibited significant activity against vaccinia virus in vitro, whereas 4a was effective against Rift Valley fever virus in mice. 5-Thiobredinin failed to exhibit appreciable antiviral or cytostatic activity (against L1210 and P388) in cell culture."

Nineteen pools of unengorged mosquitoes were found positive for RVF. All isolations were made from specimens collected at or near the naturally or artificially flooded grassland depressions that serve as the developmental sites for the immature stages of many mosquito species. The isolation of virus from adult male and female A. lineatopennis which had been reared from field-collected larvae and pupae suggests that transovarial transmission of the virus occurs in this species."
"Virology","The complete sequence of Punta Toro virus (Phlebovirus, Bunyaviridae) middle size (M), RNA has been determined. The RNA is 4330 nucleotides long (mol wt 1.46 X 10(6), base composition: 26.7% A, 33.6% U, 18.5% G, 21.2% C) and has 3'- and 5'-terminal sequences that, depending on the arrangement, are complementary for some 15 residues. The viral RNA codes in its viral-complementary sequence for a single primary gene product (the viral glycoprotein precursor) that is comprised of 1313 amino acids (146,376 Da) and is abundant in cysteine residues but has few potential asparagine-linked glycosylation sites. The 5'-noncoding region of the Punta Toro M viral-complementary RNA is short (16 nucleotides); the 3'-noncoding sequence is much longer (372 nucleotides). The latter is rich in short stretches of adenylate residues, like the 3'-noncoding regions of the Punta Toro S mRNA species (T. Ihara, H. Akashi, and D. H. L. Bishop, 1984, Virology 136, 293-306). No other large open reading frame has been identified in either the viral, or viral-complementary, M RNA sequences. Limited amino-terminal sequence analyses of the two viral glycoproteins have indicated the gene order and potential cleavage sites in the glycoprotein precursor. The data suggest the existence of a 30 X 10(3)-Da polypeptide (designated NSM) in the glycoprotein precursor that precedes the G1 protein (i.e., gene product order: NSM-G1-G2). Examination of the sequence of the Punta Toro M gene product reveals the presence of multiple hydrophobic sequences including a 19-amino acid, carboxy-proximal, hydrophobic region (G2). This hydrophobic sequence is followed by a 13-amino acid-terminal sequence rich in charged amino acids. The size and constitution of the carboxy-terminal region is consistent with a transmembranal and anchor function for the glycoprotein in the viral envelope. Other regions of the glycoprotein precursor contain sequences of amino acids with a predominantly hydrophobic character (23, 50, and 20 amino acids in length). Their functions are unknown. The amino terminus of the G1 protein is located near the end of the 23-amino acid-long hydrophobic sequence of the presumptive precursor, the hydrophobic 50-amino acid sequence lies within G1, and the amino terminus of G2 is located in the middle of the 20-amino acid-long hydrophobic sequence.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
"Virology","The entire M RNA segment of the phlebovirus Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) has been molecularly cloned and the complete nucleotide sequence determined. The RNA is 3884 nucleotides in length, corresponding to a molecular weight of 1.38 X 10(6), having a base composition of 27.3% A, 25.4% G, 27.2% U, and 20.1% C. Sequences present at the 3' and 5' termini of the molecule are largely complementary for some 51 residues and can form a stable duplex structure when the potential secondary structure of the entire molecule is considered. A single major open reading frame, capable of encoding 1206 amino acids (131,845 Da), was found in the viral-complementary sequence (""positive"" polarity). Amino-terminal amino acid sequencing of the purified viral glycoproteins G1 and G2 allowed for the positioning of the coding sequences for these polypeptides within this major open reading frame in the following orientation with respect to the genomic M RNA: 3'-G2-G1-5'. From the predicted amino acid composition of the two mature viral glycoproteins, both were found to have a high cysteine content (G2, 6%; G1, 5%). Sequences within the open reading frame capable of encoding up to 23,000 Da of polypeptide were found in addition to those required for the viral glycoproteins. The potential contribution of these sequences to the coding capacity of the M RNA, viral protein processing, and intracellular protein distribution is discussed."
"Vaccine","The serological response to immunization with a formalin inactivated Rift Valley fever (RVF) vaccine was studied in 963 Swedish UN soldiers serving in the Sinai peninsula. Antibody titres were determined with a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). Attempts were made to give all soldiers three injections (1 ml s.c. days 0, 7-10 and 28-30) but 128 soldiers received only two injections. In a group of 51 fully vaccinated individuals, repeated blood samples were collected. Fifty of the vaccinees seroconverted. Serum collected six weeks after the first vaccination revealed the highest antibody titres. The geometric mean titre then decreased rapidly during the following two weeks. Six months after vaccination sera were collected from 433 vaccinees who had received three injections and 379 had antibodies detectable by PRNT (88% PRNT greater than or equal to 10). The corresponding figures one and two years after vaccination were 223 seropositives out of 255 (91% PRNT greater than or equal to 10) and 91 out of 123 (74% PRNT greater than or equal to 10), respectively. Multiple stepwise regression showed that three injections gave a better antibody response than two injections. This analysis also showed that the magnitude of the antibody response was reduced with increasing age. Slight, local and general side effects were reported in 6% of the vaccinees and these reactions occurred in individuals with relatively higher antibody response."
"Vaccine","A booster dose of a formalin-inactivated, cell culture-propagated Rift Valley fever vaccine (TSI-GSD-200) was administered without significant reactogenicity to 60 volunteers 18 months after they received a three dose primary series. Blood was drawn for serological testing prior to boosting and 10, 49, and 180 days thereafter. Neutralizing antibody response was prompt, being maximum on day 10 and considerably higher than the peak titres obtained on day 42 after the initial series. A marked decline in antibody titres was evident by day 180, as seen for the primary series, but residual titres were substantially higher. The initial series was given in doses of 1.0, 0.5, 0.3, or 0.1 ml and the immune status achieved with these injections was a major determinant of the response to boostering. Secondary responses were highly dependent in magnitude and duration on the prior immune status of the recipient. Evaluation of dose and route of recall inoculation showed 1.0 ml given subcutaneously (SC) to be equivalent to 0.1 ml administered intradermally (ID), though inference should be guarded due to the small sample size. Although 0.1 ml SC dose was inferior to either, it was modestly effective. Intradermal administration of vaccine may be useful for extending the small reserve of vaccine available for use in emergency."
"Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy","Administration of liposome-encapsulated ribavirin to mice led to ribavirin concentrations in the liver, the primary site of Rift Valley fever virus proliferation, that were fivefold greater than those attained with the same doses of free ribavirin. Liposomal ribavirin given at a dose of either 25 or 50 mg of drug per kg of body weight protected mice against a rapidly lethal high-titer challenge with Rift Valley fever virus, whereas similar doses of free drug or empty liposomes had no detectable benefit. Hence, tissue targeting of ribavirin with liposomes substantially increased the therapeutic index by increasing the efficacy of the treatment. By using liposomes as drug carriers, a nontoxic, low-dose regimen of ribavirin had a therapeutic effect that was comparable to that achieved with higher but potentially more toxic doses of free ribavirin."

"South African medical journal = Suid-Afrikaanse tydskrif vir geneeskunde","A survey of the frequency of hepatitis B markers in 258 subjects from Kavango, northern South West Africa/Namibia, was undertaken during February - May 1983. The hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis B e antigen carrier rates were 13,6% and 2,7% respectively. Only 1,9% of the subjects were negative for all the markers tested, indicating that infection had been present at some stage in 98,1% of the sample. No known transmission method of the virus seems to fit this high exposure rate. The possibility that arthropod transmission of the virus may play a role in the epidemiology of the disease in Kavango is being investigated. All subjects tested for antibodies to hepatitis A virus were found to give a positive result. Of the arboviruses tested for, West Nile virus was usually predominant and was probably responsible for most of the arbovirus infections. Antibodies to the Sindbis, Chikungunya, Germiston and Rift Valley fever viruses were also found."
"The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene","An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to measure the quantity of Rift Valley fever (RVF) viral antigen in infected Egyptian Culex pipiens. Infectivity, as measured by plaque assay, was significantly correlated with viral antigen, as measured by the ELISA, in all groups of mosquitoes regardless of the time interval after the infectious blood meal. The proportion of noninfectious viral antigen in these groups increased with time. When individual mosquitoes were assayed the plaque assay and the ELISA techniques had similar sensitivity (100% vs. 93%, respectively) and specificity (94% vs. 94%, respectively) in detecting mosquitoes capable of transmitting virus to susceptible hamsters. The ELISA may be useful in detecting RVF-infected arthropods in the field because it provides a rapid, sensitive, and specific test."
"Journal of the South African Veterinary Association","In addition to the routine sero-epidemiological surveillance for arthropod-borne viral zoonoses in the Cape Province carried out by the Department of Medical Microbiology and State Health Department of Virology laboratory, we conducted a prospective serological investigation for virus activity during 1981 in two districts of the Province, namely the Beaufort West and Middelburg districts, which experienced heavy rainfall during the first two months of that year. The approach used was to obtain paired serum samples from identified domestic stock representative of several species from 2-5 months apart and to test them for haemagglutination inhibition antibodies to Rift Valley fever, Wesselsbron and Middelburg virus antigen preparations in order to ascertain, as an indication of viral activity, whether changes in antibody levels occurred between the collection dates. The results indicated that there was probable activity of Rift Valley fever virus and activity of Wesselsbron virus (or related flaviviruses) and Middelburg virus (or related alphaviruses) in the Karoo between the middle of February and the end of July 1981. Despite this activity and heavy rainfall registered at meteorological stations in both the Beaufort West and Middelburg districts as well as general reports of heavy rainfall and considerable mosquito activity over widespread areas of the Karoo, Eastern and S.W. Cape Province, there were no epizootics or epidemics of overt arthropod-borne zoonotic viral disease in the province during 1981."

"Developments in biological standardization","RDB is a crude preparation extracted from a plant source. It is a very potent agent for dispersion of monolayer cell cultures as well as for the preparation of primary cell suspensions. It was found to be most effective in dispersing a wide range of animal and mosquito cells and dissociating neuronal and muscular tissue for primary cell cultures. RDB was also found to be useful for preparation of primary culture for chick embryo fibroblasts. After treatment with RDB cell viability was found to be 98% as compared to 85% in trypsin treated monolayer cultures. Routine dispersion of monolayer cultures with RDB does not have any negative effect on confluency of the newly split cultures. RDB was found to have no adverse effects on viral replication and plating efficiency of Rift Valley Fever Virus, Sindbis Virus and West Nile Virus."
"The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene","Experimental studies were conducted to determine if hematophagous Diptera were capable of mechanical transmission of Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus to laboratory animals. All species tested (Glossina morsitans, Aedes aegypti, Aedes taeniorhynchus, Culex pipiens, Stomoxys calcitrans, Lutzomyia longipalpis, and Culicoides variipennis) mechanically transmitted the virus to hamsters. Mechanical transmission rates for G. morsitans ranged from 0-100%, with the probability of mechanical transmission positively correlated with initial viremia titer and negatively correlated with the time after virus exposure. Mechanical transmission of RVF virus to lambs was demonstrated with both G. morsitans and Cx. pipiens. These findings demonstrated that mechanical transmission of RVF virus by hematophagous flies may contribute to the natural transmission and dissemination of this virus."
"Bulletin of the World Health Organization","Epizootic Rift Valley fever (RVF) has occurred in Kenya four times over the last 30 years. Widespread, frequent, and persistent rainfall has been a feature of these epizootic periods. A composite statistic, based upon measurements of these rainfall characteristics, is positive during periods of epizootic Rift Valley fever. The heavy rainfall raises the level of the water table in certain areas, flooding the grassland depressions (dambos) that are the habitat of the immature forms of certain ground-pool-breeding mosquitos of the genus Aedes. RVF virus is probably transmitted transovarially in these species, very large numbers of which emerge under these damp conditions. This is when clinical signs of the disease are first seen."
"Bulletin de la Société de pathologie exotique et de ses filiales","Among the viruses which can provoke human haemorrhagic fevers, the Congo-Crimean Haemorrhagic Fever and Rift Valley Fever viruses have been discovered relatively recently in West Africa. Two human cases of severe haemorrhagic fever have been connected with Congo-CHF, in Mauritania and Burkina-Faso. The epidemiological enquiry performed in Mauritania, consequent to the appearance of the first case, has demonstrated that the patient had been contaminated by contact with camels. Twelve strains of Congo-CHF virus have been isolated from ticks taken on bovines and dromedaries in that area. The serological enquiries realized on man show that the incidence is relatively feeble; on the other hand, among animals, one finds a large distribution among small ruminants in Mauritania as well as in Senegal. The recent realization of a complete identity between the Zinga and Rift Valley Fever viruses has broadened the geographical distribution of this virus to the whole of inter-tropical Africa including Madagascar. The serological enquiries realized among men and animals in areas where the virus has been isolated from wild vectors show that the presence of antibodies is faintly superior. On the other hand, in southern Mauritania, the virus prevails among men, who get antibodies of the IGM type, which proves a recent circulation. The immunological enquiries on camels seem to corroborate these data. The Rift Valley Fever epidemic which broke out in 1978 among the human and animal populations of Egypt has, apparently, been connected with the passage of camels coming from Sudan through the intermediary halting-place of the Assuan dam.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

"The Journal of hygiene","In a preliminary seroepidemiological survey a total of 780 serum samples derived from various domestic animals of the Sudan were examined for Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus precipitating antibodies. The incidence was approximately 34.3% in sheep, 33.2% in cattle, 22% in goats, 7.9% in camels and 4% in donkeys. The findings indicated that RVF is mainly prevalent in the rich savanna areas of the south as well as the irrigated areas close to the Nile in the north. Circumstantial evidence suggests that the detected antibodies were induced by a long-standing cryptically cycling infection and that resurgence of extensive epizootics is unlikely although limited outbreaks may occur. It is concluded that RVF virus circulates across the country in a south-north range along the Nile Valley with little or no extension to the drier lands to the east and west, and that ruminants are the primary species involved in virus maintenance. These species evidently serve as main amplifiers of infection during epizootics, but whether or not they also serve as sole virus reservoirs in inter-epizootic periods has yet to be determined."
"The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene","Experiments were conducted to determine whether or not mosquitoes exhibited an increase in feeding on Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus-infected lambs as compared to uninfected ones. Overall, when given a choice between a viremic lamb, or its uninfected twin, 65% (1,264/1,943) of the engorged female Culex pipiens obtained blood from the viremic lamb. This excess of feedings on viremic lambs was demonstrated regardless of the age of the lambs, or the time period between inoculation of the lambs and exposure to mosquitoes. With 3-day-old and 6- to 8-week-old lambs, 66% of the mosquitoes obtained blood from the viremic lamb. At 28, 48, and 52 hours after infection, the percentages of mosquitoes feeding on viremic lambs were 72, 68, and 64, respectively. Temperature, as measured by the difference in temperature of the viremic lamb minus that of the control lamb, was positively correlated with mosquito feedings on young lambs (3 days old), but not on older lambs (6 to 8 weeks old). When Cx. pipiens and Aedes taeniorhynchus were simultaneously given the opportunity to feed on 3-week-old lambs, a significantly higher percentage of engorged Cx. pipiens (94/108, 87%) fed on the viremic lamb than did engorged Ae. taeniorhynchus (187/350, 53%). The data generated by this study (e.g., an excess of feedings on the viremic lambs) warrant further study to determine the significance of this observation under field conditions."
"Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy","Binary combinations of the N-nucleoside ribavirin (1-beta-D-ribofuranosyl-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide) and the C-nucleoside analog selenazofurin (2-beta-D-ribofuranosylselenazole-4-carboxamide) or tiazofurin (2-beta-D-ribofuranosylthiazole-4-carboxamide) were tested in vitro for activity against Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis, Japanese encephalitis, yellow fever, Rift Valley fever, Korean hemorrhagic fever, and Pichinde viruses. The 50% effective dose for each compound alone or in a series of combinations was determined with a plaque reduction assay. Combinations of ribavirin and selenazofurin were synergistic against Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis, Japanese encephalitis, yellow fever, and Pichinde viruses, with fractional inhibitory concentrations of 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.4, respectively, but showed additive effects against Korean hemorrhagic fever and Rift Valley fever viruses. Combinations of ribavirin and tiazofurin were synergistic against yellow fever and Japanese encephalitis (fractional inhibitory concentrations, 0.41 and 0.48, respectively) but showed additive effects against Korean hemorrhagic fever virus. Combinations of selenazofurin and tiazofurin had additive effects against Japanese encephalitis, yellow fever, and Korean hemorrhagic fever viruses. The effect of combinations on cell toxicity was additive, both in monolayers of nondividing cells incubated under agar for the same period as the plaque assay and for rapidly dividing cells given short-term exposure (4 h), followed by determination of the proportion of surviving cells with a colony forming assay."
"Science (New York, N.Y.)","Infection, dissemination, and transmission of an arbovirus in mosquitoes are enhanced by concurrent ingestion of microfilariae. Ingestion of Rift Valley fever virus alone infected only 64 percent of female Aedes taeniorhynchus. Of these, only 5 percent of refeeding mosquitoes actually transmitted virus. In contrast, ingestion of the same amount of virus from concurrently microfilaremic (Brugia malayi) gerbils resulted in 88 percent infection and 31 percent transmission. Enhanced transmission of virus may be attributed to increased transit of virus across the midgut wall. Endemic filariasis may promote arbovirus transmission in nature."
"Acta pathologica, microbiologica, et immunologica Scandinavica. Section C, Immunology","The protection by active and passive immunization of Golden Syrian hamsters challenged with Rift Valley Fever (RVF) virus intraperitoneally was studied. Six groups of 10 hamsters were inoculated with different amounts of immune serum while five groups were actively immunized with different doses of a formalin-inactivated RVF vaccine. One day after passive and three weeks after active immunization all hamsters were challenged with 5000 plaque-forming units of RVF virus. Plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNT) were performed with serum samples collected immediately before challenge. A PRNT titer of 10-20 or more was required for full protection against the RVF challenge in both actively and passively immunized hamsters. Actively immunized hamsters and control animals that succumbed to the infection died within the first 4 days after virus challenge, whereas some passively immunized hamsters died as late as 11 days post virus challenge. Animals that died early had developed massive liver necrosis, whereas late death was caused by encephalitis."
"The Journal of antimicrobial chemotherapy","Infection of humans by viruses belonging to the families of Toga-, Bunya-, and Arenaviridae constitutes a major health problem worldwide and certain of the viruses have the potential to cause widespread epidemics. In the search for effective chemotherapy against these viruses several hundred nucleoside and nucleotide analogues have been screened for antiviral activity. Of the compounds tested, ribavirin, has been shown in laboratory animal models to have significant inhibitory effects against Rift Valley Fever virus, the bunyavirus Punta Toro, Hantaan virus and arenaviruses such as Pichinde, Junin, Machupo and Lassa Fever. Clinical studies with ribavirin in persons infected with Lassa Fever virus are in progress. Ribavirin or certain analogues have no detectable in vivo activity against arboviral encephalitic infections caused by Venezuelan or Western Equine Encephalitis or Semliki Forest Viruses. Other compounds including a series of triazolo derivatives, and the thiazole carboxamide nucleoside Tiazofurin appear to have in-vivo activity against certain of these exotic RNA viruses."

The N, G1, G2, and 80K proteins were present in virion preparations. Sequential studies showed that NS1 accumulated in the nucleus as soon as it was formed and readily associated with nuclei partitioned from noninfected cells.

"Journal of clinical microbiology","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is an important human and animal pathogen in Africa and has been responsible for infections in travelers. Because of the aerosol infectivity and risk of dissemination of the virus, a need exists for simple, safe, serological tests for diagnosis. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed to detect RVFV-specific immunoglobulins (immunoglobulin G [IgG] and IgM). In the test, a betapropiolactone-inactivated, sucrose-acetone-extracted, suckling mouse liver RVFV antigen was captured by mouse RVFV antibodies adsorbed to polystyrene plates. The test sample (human serum) was then added, and the binding of specific antibodies was indicated by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated swine anti-human IgG or IgM. A mu-capture IgM ELISA was also developed by using polystyrene plates coated with goat anti-human IgM incubated successively with serum sample, RVFV antigen, and indicator antibodies. The ELISA for RVFV-specific IgG proved to be more sensitive than hemagglutination inhibition or complement fixation tests and almost as sensitive as the plaque reduction neutralization test in detecting specific antibodies in human sera after vaccination. The two ELISA IgM tests could detect specific IgM antibodies during the first 6 weeks after RVFV vaccination. Three injections of inactivated vaccine were given on days 0, 6 to 8, and 32 to 34. ELISA IgM values for sera obtained on days 6 to 8 were negative or in the lower range of significance, on days 32 to 34 they were strongly positive, and on days 42 to 52 they were waning. Later sera were negative. The plague reduction neutralization test was negative on days 6 to 8 but rose progressively in later samples. These findings suggest that the three doses of RVFV vaccine induce a prolonged primary antibody response. The ELISA IgM could become an important tool for early diagnosis in acute human infection. A number of African sera, some of which were positive for RVFV by plaque reduction neutralization test, were also tested by ELISA IgG. There was good agreement between both tests."
"The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene","Following ingestion of 10(4.2) to 10(7.2) plaque-forming units (PFU) of Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus, 662 of 850 female Culex pipiens (78%) became infected. Those mosquitoes that became infected separated into two distinct groups: 1) those with a nondisseminated infection limited to the gut, and 2) those with a disseminated infection. The former group contained a median of 10(3.2) PFU, while those females with a disseminated infection contained a median of 10(5.5) PFU. Only those females with a disseminated infection were capable of transmitting virus by bite to a susceptible hamster. This is consistent with a mesenteronal escape barrier to viral dissemination. Following intrathoracic inoculation of RVF virus, all females developed a disseminated infection (26/26) and successfully transmitted virus by bite (49/49) if allowed to feed on a susceptible hamster or suckling mouse. Examination of legs and bodies separately provided a rapid and efficient method of determining dissemination status."
"Archives de l'Institut Pasteur de Madagascar","Virus Zinga strains have been isolated from several pools of mosquitoes collected in Perinet area, 130 km far from Tananarive, at the Institut Pasteur of Madagascar in 1980. Although this virus is pathogenic for man, it seemed to give only a mild illness and did not appear to constitute a problem of Public Health. But today it is seen in quite a different way; since the WHO Center for Arbovirus Reference and Research of New Haven has shown the serologic identity between virus Zinga and an another arbovirus, Rift Valley Fever virus. This latter is in fact very pathogenic for man and domestic animal, he is responsible of important epizootics characterized by many abortions in pregnancies and death of newborn animals, many infections have occurred in man during these epizootics and the disease is able to give a mortal haemorragic syndrome. Until now, no particular aggressivity has been shown by virus Zinga in Madagascar, but it remains a real potential danger for man and for domestic animals."
"The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene","Field and laboratory findings implicated Culex pipiens as a vector of Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus during the 1977-1978 epizootics/epidemics in Egypt. This study evaluated changes in infection and transmission rates, and viral titers in F1 through F16 generation Cx. pipiens mosquitoes orally infected with RVF virus. Infection and transmission rates of RVF virus by this species changed significantly during the colonization process. However, the ultimate viral titers of either the transmitting or the infected nontransmitting mosquitoes were not affected by the colonization process. Following ingestion of virus, Cx. pipiens could be separated into three distinct subpopulations, an uninfected group and two types of infected mosquitoes--transmitters and nontransmitters. Transmitters contained significantly more virus (approximately 100-fold) than nontransmitters. These results demonstrated that not every infected female mosquito should be considered a competent vector, even if the species (population) is known to be a primary vector. Transmission was also accomplished by probing mosquitoes which were unsuccessful in obtaining a blood meal. These data document the long-held suspicion that vector competence studies based upon laboratory-colonized specimens may not represent the field situation."
"Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy","The relative in vitro antiviral activities of three related nucleoside carboxamides, ribavirin (1-beta-D-ribofuranosyl-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide), tiazofurin (2-beta-D-ribofuranosylthiazole-4-carboxamide), and selenazole (2-beta-D-ribofuranosylselenazole-4-carboxamide), were studied against selected DNA and RNA viruses. Although the activity of selenazole against different viruses varied, it was significantly more potent than ribavirin and tiazofurin against all tested representatives of the families Paramyxoviridae (parainfluenza virus type 3, mumps virus, measles virus), Reoviridae (reovirus type 3), Poxviridae (vaccinia virus), Herpes-viridae (herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2), Togaviridae (Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis virus, yellow fever virus, Japanese encephalitis virus), Bunyaviridae (Rift Valley fever virus, sandfly fever virus [strain Sicilian], Korean hemorrhagic fever virus), Arenaviridae (Pichinde virus), Picornaviridae (coxsackieviruses B1 and B4, echovirus type 6, encephalomyocarditis virus), Adenoviridae (adenovirus type 2), and Rhabdoviridae (vesicular stomatitis virus). The antiviral activity of selenazole was also cell line dependent, being greatest in HeLa, Vero-76, and Vero E6 cells. Selenazole was relatively nontoxic for Vero, Vero-76, Vero E6, and HeLa cells at concentrations of up to 1,000 micrograms/ml. The relative plating efficiency at that concentration was over 90%. The effects of selenazole on viral replication were greatest when this agent was present at the time of viral infection. The removal of selenazole from the medium of infected cells did not reverse the antiviral effect against vaccinia virus, but there was a gradual resumption of viral replication in cells infected with parainfluenza type 3 or herpes simplex virus type 1 (strain KOS). However, the antiviral activity of ribavirin against the same viruses was reversible when the drug was removed."
"The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene","Eight new members of the phlebotomus fever arbovirus serogroup (family Bunyaviridae; genus Phlebovirus) from the Amazon region of Brazil are described. One serotype was recovered from a febrile patient, three from small wild animals and four from sand flies. A small serum survey carried out with the human isolate, Alenquer virus, suggests that it rarely infects man. Complement-fixation and plaque reduction neutralization tests were done, comparing the eight new viruses with other members of the phlebotomus fever serogroup. A close antigenic relationship was demonstrated between one of the new agents (Belterra) and Rift Valley fever virus. This finding is of considerable interest and deserves further investigation. Addition of these eight new viruses to the genus Phlebovirus brings to 14 the number of serotypes known to occur in the Amazon region and to 36 the total number reported worldwide. More detailed clinical and epidemiological studies should be conducted in Amazonia in order to define the public health impact caused by phleboviruses."

Antibodies were purified from hyperimmune mouse and rabbit sera by affinity chromatography, using CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B coupled to a beta-propiolactone-inactivated sucrose-acetone-extracted suckling mouse liver antigen. In the assay, antigen was captured by mouse antibody adsorbed to polystyrene plates and then detected by reacting sequentially with rabbit anti-Rift Valley fever virus antibody and swine anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G conjugated to alkaline phosphatase. ELISA proved to be useful in measuring viral antigen in different animal systems. However, great variation was found in the amount of antigen per PFU encountered in different circumstances. The ELISA system was optimized using supernatant fluids from infected Vero cell cultures and had a sensitivity of 10(5) PFU/ml. Hamsters develop progressive viremia, much as seen in susceptible domestic animals, such as lambs; ELISA could reliably detect 10(6) PFU/ml of viremic hamster serum. Rhesus monkeys with Rift Valley fever infection were positive by ELISA even when viremias were only 5 X 10(3) PFU/ml.

Cells coated with crude antibody, in the form of mouse immune ascitic fluid, reacted with high specificity and sensitivity in RPHA tests with live or inactivated virus antigens. In inhibition (RPHI) tests, RVF antibody titers in human and sheep sera were similar to those determined by hemagglutination inhibition test. RVF virus antigen could be detected in viremic sheep sera by the RPHA technique. RPHI antibody titers to CCHF virus in human and hare sera were similar to indirect immunofluorescence (IF) titers, but sheep and cattle sera with RPHI titers of 1:32 or less were negative in IF tests."

Over a 21-month period investigations, including virus isolation attempts, patient and contact serology, visits to areas where suspected cases occurred, interviewing family members and neighbours of suspected cases and following up any additional illnesses in these areas, were carried out. During the study two cases were found that were likely to have been Ebola haemorrhagic fever based on rising antibody titres or positive serology in contacts. Diagnoses of hepatitis A, hepatitis B, malaria, bacterial septicaemia or other causes were arrived at in 24 cases. No diagnosis could be made in 26 instances. 741 human sera were tested for antibodies against Marburg, Ebola, Congo haemorrhagic fever, Rift Valley fever or Lassa fever viruses by indirect fluorescence. Eight sera were positive for Ebola virus antibodies, all of which were from suspected cases or contacts of suspected cases. Two sera were antibody positive to Congo virus and one had antibodies against Rift Valley fever virus. No Marburg or Lassa virus antibodies were detected."

"Bulletin of the World Health Organization","This Memorandum considers the use of veterinary vaccines for the prevention of Rift Valley fever (RVF) and for its control during outbreaks. Veterinary vaccines are the first line of defence against RVF. Existing live and inactivated vaccines have been used extensively in Africa but further development of both is warranted. The live virus vaccine may cause abortion and its potential for reversion to virulence has not been adequately investigated. It should be used only in enzootic and epizootic areas. The inactivated vaccines are effective and safe, but they are more expensive and at least 2 doses must be given. They are currently produced only in Egypt and South Africa. Diagnosis of RVF is made by isolation of virus or demonstration of an elevated serum antibody titre. Reference laboratories are available to assist in the diagnosis. In the event of an outbreak of RVF, the appropriate international authorities should be notified and immunization of livestock should be carried out according to the guidelines described herein. Movement of animals should be controlled during epizootics. Guidelines for action for neighbouring countries are also given. The immunization policies recommended for sub-Saharan Africa differ from those for areas beyond the enzootic range, where use of killed vaccine only is recommended. The enzootic and epizootic areas in East Africa are characterized according to their ecology. The description serves as a predictive guide for other parts of Africa and can aid in setting immunization policy. Recommended WHO specifications are given for the inactivated RVF vaccine, including description of substrates, seed virus, potency, and safety testing. Future research needs include experiments on potency, thermal stability, adjuvants, immunity, virus markers, and genetic stability. Longer-term vaccine development envisages reassortant vaccines, gene cloning to produce recombinant DNA products, and synthetic polypeptide vaccines."

Antibodies against Ebola virus, particularly the Zaire strain, were detected in all regions and were, over-all, more abundant than antibodies against the other antigens. Ebola and Marburg antibody prevalence rates were highest in the samples from Lodwar and Laisamis, both semi-desert areas. Antibodies against Rift Valley fever virus were also highest in the Lodwar sample followed by Malindi/Kilifi and Laisamis. Congo haemorrhagic fever virus antibodies were rare and no antibodies against Lassa virus were detected in the 1899 sera tested."

"Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences","Enzyme treatment (protease or trypsin) was applied to formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded materials and virus-infected cultured cells to detect viral antigens by immunofluorescence. The viral antigens were demonstrated in several organs of autopsy or biopsy cases of which diagnoses had been established by immunofluorescence or virus isolation using frozen materials, or suspected on the basis of serology and/or histopathological findings. These included herpes simplex, varicella-zoster, cytomegalo, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, Japanese B encephalitis, measles, acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis, Lassa and Korean hemorrhagic fever. Antigen could be recovered also in virus-infected cells (herpes simplex, measles, Lassa, Ebola, Marburg, Rift Valley, Congo and Korean Hemorrhagic fever) by enzyme treatment after periods of formalin fixation of four weeks and storage of three months. In herpes simplex virus-infected mouse brain, antigen was detected after fixation for three months in formalin."

"Antiviral research","The antibiotic pyrazofurin, 3-(beta-D-ribofuranosyl)-4-hydroxypyrazole-5-carboxamide, markedly inhibited the in vitro replication of a number of RNA viruses including Rift Valley fever (RVF), Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis (VEE), Sandfly, Pichinde, Lassa and LCM virus. Plaque formation was reduced by 80% or more with 2-10 micrograms/ml of pyrazofurin while 2 micrograms/ml reduced by 1000-fold the yield of Lassa and LCM virus in a yield reduction assay. In vivo, pyrazofurin failed to protect mice and guinea pigs against a lethal challenge with VEE and Pichinde virus, respectively. On the other hand, pyrazofurin caused a slight increase in the mean time to death of mice infected with RVF virus."
"Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association","Recombinant DNA technology appears to be on the verge of producing safe and effective protein vaccines for animal and human diseases. The procedure is applicable to most viruses because their isolated surface proteins generally possess immunogenic activity. Strategies used for the preparation and cloning of the appropriate genes depend on the characteristics of the viral genomes: whether DNA or RNA; their size, strandedness, and segmentation; and whether messenger RNA are monocistronic or polycistronic. Cloned surface proteins of foot-and-mouth disease and hepatitis B viruses are being tested for possible use as practical vaccines. Two doses of the cloned foot-and-mouth disease viral protein have elicited large amounts of neutralizing antibody and have protected cattle and swine against challenge exposure with the virus. Surface proteins have also been cloned for the viruses of fowl plague, influenza, vesicular stomatitis, rabies, and herpes simplex. Cloning is in progress for surface proteins of viruses causing canine parvovirus gastroenteritis, human papillomas, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis, Rift Valley fever, and paramyxovirus diseases. In addition, advances in recombinant DNA and other facilitating technologies have rekindled interest in the chemical synthesis of polypeptide vaccines for viral diseases. The bioengineering of bacterial vaccines is also under way. Proteinaceous pili of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli are being produced in E coli K-12 strains for use as vaccines against neonatal diarrheal diseases of livestock."
"American journal of epidemiology","A formalin-inactivated Rift Valley fever vaccine, originally produced in primary monkey kidney cells, has been used to protect laboratory workers. A trial of a modified vaccine, newly formulated in well-characterized diploid fetal rhesus lung cells, was conducted with 114 men aged 19--24 years. Of the 107 subjects who received up to three injections of 0.1 to 1 ml vaccine (an additional seven received a placebo) one had a local hypersensitivity-type reaction and another a generalized urticarial syndrome. Both cases had a prior history of hypersensitivity states. No pyrogenicity was detected and only insignificant systemic reactions were recorded. Mild and transient local reactions ranged from 5% at the lowest dose level to 43% at the highest. Serologic response, as assessed by plaque reduction neutralizing antibody titers, was dose dependent. Within a single vaccine lot tested at multiple dose levels, peak (day 42) geometric mean titers ranged from 48 (at 0.1 ml x 3) to 436 (at 1.0 ml x 3). Reciprocal titers of greater than or equal to 40 are considered to be protective. Comparison of three lots at the 0.5 ml level indicated between lot variability, though this was not statistically significant. A sharp decline in antibody titers was observed in all vaccination groups by day 84; six months after vaccination apparently protective antibody titers were present only in groups that received 1 ml x 3 and 0.5 ml x 3 of the most antigenic lot of vaccine. These results suggest that 1) the vaccine is generally nonreactogenic, but individuals with a prior history of hypersensitivity states should be observed for allergic side effects; 2) existing vaccine supplies cannot be extended by using lower dose levels without a lower and less sustained serologic response; 3) a booster dose is necessary six months or more following the primary series; 4) although the current TSI-GSD-200 vaccine is immunogenic, a more potent vaccine is needed."

"The Onderstepoort journal of veterinary research","The macroscopic and microscopic lesions in livers of new-born lambs experimentally infected with Rift Valley fever virus and killed at various intervals between 6-53 h after inoculation, were described in a previous paper. This communication gives an overview of the ultrastructural changes affecting hepatocytes, sinusoids and spaces of Disse, biliary tree and portal triads as well as observations on the morphology and morphogenesis of the virus. Hepatocytes were those primarily affected, while inflammatory and architectural changes were secondary. The changes included prominent nuclear alterations, fragmentation or disintegration of necrotic hepatocytes, focal cytoplasmic degradation and sequestration, and the presence of acidophilic bodies. The ultrastructure and origin of the intranuclear inclusions are discussed."
"The Onderstepoort journal of veterinary research","Ten new-born lambs were necropsied at various intervals after artificial infection with Rift Valley fever virus for the study of the sequential development of the hepatic lesions. During the late stage of the disease, the livers were slightly to moderately swollen and mottled yellow, orange-brown and red. Greyish-white foci, approximately 0,25-0,5 mm in diameter, were also scattered throughout the parenchyma. Microscopically, the liver lesions progressed from sparsely distributed acidophilic bodies and hepatocytes, revealing acidophilic degeneration and necrosis 6-12 h post-inoculation, to small randomly scattered primary foci of necrosis 12-24 h after infection. At 30-36 h, these primary foci were larger and more circumscribed. In addition, numerous acidophilic bodies and necrotic hepatocytes were dispersed throughout the markedly degenerated parenchyma. The terminal stage of the disease (48-53 h after inoculation), was characterized by massive hepatic necrosis in which primary foci of necrosis could still be recognized as dense aggregates of cytoplasmic and nuclear debris."

""Onyalai,"" a bleeding disease in tropical Africa, often fatal, was related to profound thrombocytopenia possibly following administration of toxic witch doctor medicine. Spirochetal diseases, and rickettsial diseases in their severe forms, are often manifested with hemorrhagic complications. Of enterovirus infections, Coxsackie B viruses occasionally caused severe hepatitis associated with bleeding, especially in newborn babies. Cases of hemorrhagic fever presenting in February-March, 1975 are described. The first outbreak was due to Marburg virus disease and the second, which included seven fatal cases, was caused by Rift Valley fever virus. In recent cases of hemorrhagic fever a variety of infective organisms have been incriminated including bacterial infections, rickettsial diseases, and virus diseases, including Herpesvirus hominis; in one patient, the hemorrhagic state was related to rubella. A boy who died in a hemorrhagic state was found to have Congo fever; another patient who died of severe bleeding from the lungs was infected with Leptospira canicola, and two patients who developed a hemorrhagic state after a safari trip in Northern Botswana were infected with Trypanosoma rhodesiense. An illness manifested by high fever and melena developed in a young man after a visit to Zimbabwe; the patient was found to have both malaria and Marburg virus disease."
"The Onderstepoort journal of veterinary research","Since the original description of Rift Valley fever in sheep, cattle and man in the Rift Valley in Kenya in 1931, very little has been published on the disease in cattle. This report deals with the macroscopic and microscopic pathology of field cases of Rift Valley fever in 22 adult cattle, 8 calves and 8 aborted foetuses. The microscopic liver lesions in 13 adult cattle were characterized by marked centri- and midzonal eosinophilic necrosis, involving almost 2/3 of the lobules, and accompanied by sparsely distributed primary foci of necrosis. In 3 animals, however, the hepatic lesions were more focal in nature, while a massive hepatic necrosis was evident in 6 others. In calves, the lesions in the liver ranged from cases showing numerous haphazardly scattered primary foci of necrosis to cases where the latter were accompanied by eosinophilic necrosis of the remaining hepatocytes in the lobules. Vascular lesions, thrombosis and sinusoidal fibrin deposits were sometimes seen in the livers of both calves and adult cattle. Although the aborted foetuses were in a fairly advanced state of autolysis, it was still possible to make a diagnosis of Rift Valley fever from the characteristic lesions which were similar to those reported for new-born lambs. Other noteworthy lesions in adult cattle and calves included pyknosis and karyorrhexis of lymphocytes in the spleen and lymph nodes, widespread serosal and visceral haemorrhages which were sometimes accompanied by copious free blood in the gastrointestinal tract, and a nephrosis."
"The Onderstepoort journal of veterinary research","The clinical symptoms and pathology in 33 adult sheep and 31 adult goats experimentally infected with Wesselsbron disease virus are described. There was moderate to severe hyperthermia in most animals, but no other clinical signs of disease or deaths were recorded. Eleven sheep and 6 goats were sacrificed for pathological studies at various stages during the febrile response. The macroscopic and microscopic lesions in these cases are described. Microscopic studies revealed that the liver was consistently affected and showed small foci of necrosis. These were sparsely distributed and associated with a marked localized Kupffer cell response (""retothelial nodules""). In addition, acidophilic bodies and small groups of necrotic hepatocytes were evident in some lobules. Apart from the hepatic lesions, mild to moderate pyknosis and karyorrhexis of lymphocytes were seen in the spleen and lymph nodes.

Insects from a colony maintained at the Animal Virus Research Institute, Pirbright, were fed through a membrane on a mixture of mouse blood and RVFV (virus concentration of blood meal 7 X 95 log10 MLD50ml). Engorged insects were maintained at 25 degrees C +/- 1 degrees C. Samples of insects were tested at daily intervals to determine their virus content. Four of the five females tested immediately after feeding contained virus. The mean virus concentration of these infected flies was 2 X 7 log10MLD50. The virus concentration per fly decreased to 0 by day 2 post infection. On day 3, a virus concentration of 2 X 4 log10 MLD50 per fly was recorded from a pool of 17 flies but between day 4 and day 12 when the experiment terminated no virus was detected in any of the 135 females tested. Because of the pathogenic nature of RVFV, this work was carried out under the stringent security regulations at the PHLS Centre for Applied Microbiology and Research, Porton Down.

"Bulletin of the World Health Organization","Rift Valley fever (RVF) is primarily a disease of sheep, cattle, other domestic animals, and man; it was believed to be relatively benign for man until 1977 when it spread to Egypt. There it caused enormous losses of sheep and cattle, and thousands of human cases occurred, with nearly 600 reported deaths. Although mosquitos are known to transmit RVF virus in epizootics and epidemics, the reservoir and means of inter-epizootic maintenance are not known. RVF epizootics can be recognized by a combination of observations: abortions and neonatal death in sheep and cattle at times when mosquitos are abundant, accompanied by cases of fever in man, which are complicated in a minority of patients by haemorrhagic fever, encephalitis, and retinitis with blindness. Vaccination of livestock with available killed or live attenuated vaccines should prevent transmission to both human subjects and animals. Although routine quarantine of animals is not deemed a practical measure, movement of animals should be restricted when an epizootic is in progress. Since it is possible that RVF may spread from Africa in the future, serological surveillance in man and animals is recommended in potentially receptive countries of the Mediterranean Basin and South-West Asia to establish baseline data and to familiarize staff with the methods of RVF diagnosis."
"Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene","Variants of Rift Valley fever virus producing plaques in CER cells of four different sizes are described. A plaque-forming unit (PFU) variant forming minute plaques was isolated and purified. Virus derived from this variant was not pathogenic to adult Swiss albino mice by the intraperitoneal (i.p.) route and was less pathogenic than the parent strain (ZH501) to adult Sprague Dawley rats by i.p. route, but produced typical severe liver necrosis in adult Syrian hamsters with intranuclear and intracytoplasmic eosinophilic inclusions. Antigen and antiserum to the minute variant prepared in mice reciprocally cross-reacted with antisera and antigens of the original strain (ZH501) in the complement fixation test. Plaque size of the minute variant remained constant after serial passages in cell culture and in suckling mouse brain. When the minute plaque variant was passaged i.p. in hamsters, virus which formed large plaques in CER cells was recovered from the hamster sera."
"Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene","In the aftermath of an extensive Egyptian Rift Valley fever (RVF) epidemic during 1977-78, RVF activity in the adjacent Sinai peninsula has been inferred from the presence of haemagglutination-inhibition (HI) antibodies in sera from indigenous humans and rodents. We attempted to confirm these findings by HI testing of sera from Israeli soldiers serving in the region of the El Arish Wadi system in the Sinai, and from indigenous rodents. Six of 199 human sera (3.0%) and two of 88 rodent sera (2.3%) were positive, but none reacted in the more specific plaque-reduction neutralization test. We conclude that there is no definitive serological evidence for RVF activity in the Sinai and that sera reacting in the HI test must be confirmed by a more specific serological procedure."

"Infection and immunity","The respiratory infectivity of a strain of Rift Valley fever virus isolated in Egypt (strain ZH-501) was compared with that of one isolate from Uganda (Entebbe strain) and two isolates from South Africa (strains SA-51 and SA-75). Studies were performed with ICR mice which were infected by exposure to infectious aerosols composed of particles with a mass median diameter of 0.96 micrometer. The respiratory median lethal doses for ZH-501, Entebbe, SA-51, and SA-75 were 2.2, 1.9, 2.6, and 1.9 log10 plaque-forming units, respectively. Although these values are statistically different, the biological implications of such differences seem unimportant. In an additional study of pathogenesis, a single group of mice was infected with 3.1 log10 plaque-forming units of ZH-501, and tissues were assayed sequentially through 96 h postinfection. Between 6 and 30 h, demonstration of an increasing virus concentration only in the lungs indicated that initial replication occurred there; however, determination of histopathological changes did not reveal evidence of pneumonia. Virus was isolated from the liver by 48 h, and the ultimate outcome of infection was a fulminating and fatal hepatic necrosis."

Compared to the other cell lines tested (Vero, BHK-21 and Aedes albopictus), CV-1 cells were found to be more sensitive. Viral antigens were detected by IFA from a few hours post inoculation (CHIK and RVF) to a maximum of 3 days (YF and EBO). For most of the viruses studied, the cytopathic effect (CPE) commenced 2-3 days after the detection of viral antigens.

"South African medical journal = Suid-Afrikaanse tydskrif vir geneeskunde","During an epizootic of Rift Valley fever in South Africa in 1974/1975, mainly affecting sheep and cattle, a large number of human cases occurred. The majority of the patients, mostly farmers, farm labourers and veterinary surgeons, acquired the infection while handling the carcasses of animals which had died of Rift Valley fever. Some gave no history of contact with infected animals and it is presumed that they were infected by mosquitoes. Complications were common. Retinitis clinically associated with defective vision occurred in about 20% of patients investigated. In others, meningo-encephalitis developed; 1 patient died and the brain showed perivascular cuffing and round-cell infiltration. In 110 cases the diagnosis was confirmed in the laboratory, in 17 by isolation of the virus and in 93 by the finding of an antibody response in serological tests. In 3 fatal cases the virus was isolated from the liver, and in a further 4 fatal cases in which virus isolation was not attempted, there was clinical and epidemiological evidence of the diagnosis; in each case a haemorrhagic state associated with hepatitis had developed. In 1978, follow-up studies showed that immune rates among residents on affected farms varied from 10% in children to 17,1% in adult males, with an overall immunity rate of 14,5%."

Over 95% of the 55,126 mosquitoes collected from epizootic areas in the Nile Delta and Valley were Culex pipiens. Two strains of RVF virus were isolated from unengorged female C. pipiens taken in 1978. Laboratory-reared C. pipiens originating from a population sample from the Nile Delta epizootic area transmitted RVF virus. The infection rate of mosquitoes that fed on viremic hamsters was 86.7%; the transmission rate was 40.0% (46.2% based only on infected mosquitoes). From these results, it is suggested that C. pipiens was a vector of RVF virus during the 1977-1978 epizootics in Egypt."
"Infection and immunity","We conducted studies with mice, rats, and monkeys which demonstrated the ability of glucan to induce either nonspecific or specific enhancement of host resistance to infectious diseases. Intravenous pretreatment of mice with glucan significantly enhanced the survival of mice challenged with either Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis (VEE) virus or Rift Valley fever virus. Pretreatment was beneficial when initiated 3 days before challenge with VEE virus and 7 days before challenge with Rift Valley fever virus. Treatment of mice after VEE challenge did not increase their survival compared with controls. Glucan pretreatment of rats provided increased resistance to both intraperitoneal and low-dose aerosol challenges with virulent Francisella tularensis when the glucan was given intravenously, but not when it was administered intranasally. In contrast, intranasal glucan pretreatment enhanced the survival of mice when they were challenged by aerosol with Pseudomonas pseudomallei, whereas intravenous glucan pretreatment did not increase survival. mice given glucan combined with a marginally immunogenic dose of VEE vaccine were more resistant to homologous virus challenge than were mice given either Freund complete adjuvant plus vaccine or vaccine alone. Similarly, both primary and secondary VEE antibody titers in cynomolgus monkeys given glucan with VEE vaccine were significantly greater than titers in vaccine controls."
"American journal of veterinary research","A formalin-inactivated Rift Valley fever (RVF) vaccine prepared in cell culture for human use was immunogenic in sheep.

Seven of 11 vaccinated sheep with prechallenge plaque-reduction neutralization (PRN80) antibody titers of less than or equal to 10 were protected against challenge exposure with 10(6) plaque-forming units of Zagazig 501 strain of RVF virus. Challenge exposure induced abortion in 2 of 2 pregnant sheep. Five sheep with PRN80 titers greater than or equal 1:20 were protected from detectable viremia after challenge exposure. Additionally, 5 of 6 lambs (3 months old) were protected (by maternal antibodies) against challenge exposure. Challenge control sheep developed clinical disease and detectable viremia after exposure. Virus was isolated from saliva of 1 challenge control sheep and virus was transmitted by contact exposure to 1 of 4 seronegative contact-control sheep. Immunization of sheep with formalin-inactivated RVF vaccine induced a priming effect against RVF viral antigens. Challenge exposure with RVF virus resulted in significantly higher neutralizing titers in vaccinated sheep than in nonvaccinated sheep."

"The Journal of hygiene","The spread of insect-borne animal virus diseases is influenced by a number of factors. Hosts migrate, move or are conveyed over long distances: vectors are carried on the wind for varying distances in search of hosts and breeding sites; weather and climate affect hosts and vectors through temperature, moisture and wind. As parasites of host and vector, viruses are carried by animals, birds and insects, and their spread can be correlated with the migration of hosts and the carriage of vectors on winds associated with the movements of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and warm winds to the north and south of the limits of the ITCZ. The virus is often transmitted from a local cycle to a migratory cycle and back again.Examples of insect-borne virus diseases and their spread are analysed. Japanese, Murray Valley, Western equine, Eastern equine and St Louis encephalitis represent viruses transmitted by mosquito-bird or pig cycles.THE AREAS EXPERIENCING INFECTION WITH THESE VIRUSES CAN BE DIVIDED INTO A NUMBER OF ZONES: A, B, C, D, E and F. In zone A there is a continuous cycle of virus in host and vector throughout the year; in zone B, there is an upsurge in the cycle during the wet season, but the cycle continues during the dry season; there is movement of infected vectors between and within zones A and B on the ITCZ and the virus is introduced to zone C by infected vectors on warm winds; persistence may occur in zone C if conditions are right. In zone D, virus is introduced each year by infected vectors on warm winds and the arrival of the virus coincides with the presence of susceptible nestling birds and susceptible piglets. The disappearance of virus occurs at the time when migrating mosquitoes and birds are returning to warmer climates. The virus is introduced to zone E only on occasions every 5-10 years when conditions are suitable. Infected hosts introduced to zone F do not lead to circulation of virus, since the climate is unsuitable for vectors. Zones A, B and C correspond to endemic and zones D and E to epidemic conditions.Similar zones can be recognized for African horse sickness, bluetongue, Ibaraki disease and bovine ephemeral fever - examples of diseases transmitted in a midge-mammal cycle. In zones A and B viruses are transported by infected midges carried on the wind in association with the movement of ITCZ and undergo cycles in young animals. In these zones and in zone C there is a continual movement of midges on the warm wind between one area and another, colonizing new sites or reinforcing populations of midges already present. Virus is introduced at times into fringe areas (zones D and E) and, as there is little resistance in the host, gives rise to clinical signs of disease. In some areas there is persistence during adverse conditions; in others, the virus is carried back to the endemic zones by infected midges or vectors.Examples of viruses maintained in a mosquito/biting fly-mammal cycle are Venezuelan equine encephalitis and vesicular stomatitis. These viruses enter a migratory cycle from a local cycle and the vectors in the migratory cycle are carried over long distances on the wind. Further examples of virus spread by movement of vectors include West Nile, Rift Valley fever, yellow fever, epizootic haemorrhagic disease of deer and Akabane viruses.In devising means of control it is essential to decide the relationship of host, vector and virus and the nature of the zone in which the area to be controlled lies. Because of the continual risk of reintroduction of infected vectors, it is preferable to protect the host by dipping, spraying or by vaccination rather than attempting to eliminate the local population of insects."

Hamsters and mice inoculated with lipid emulsion plus western or Venezuelan equine encephalitis vaccine were significantly more resistant than vaccinated controls to lethal homologous virus challenge. Sheep given one dose of lipid emulsion plus Rift Valley fever vaccine developed significantly higher antibody titers than control sheep receiving only vaccine. Cynomolgous monkeys inoculated with lipid emulsion plus Rift Valley fever vaccine developed 16-fold greater peak primary and 20-fold greater secondary antibody titers than those of vaccine controls. Similar lipid emulsion-Rift Valley fever studies in rhesus monkeys resulted in 37- and 300-fold increases in primary and secondary titers, respectively, compared with monkeys given vaccine alone. Neither the sequence of combining antigen with lipid nor the exact ratio of aqueous phase to lipid phase affected the survival of Venezuelan equine encephalitis-vaccinated mice challenged with homologous lethal virus. This lipid formulation has several advantages over other water-in-oil adjuvants for potential use in humans. The components are metabolizable or normal host constituents, it is easily emulsified with aqueous vaccines by gentle agitation, and it is relatively nonreactogenic in recipients."

"The British journal of ophthalmology","Ocular manifestations resulting from Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus infection were studied during an extensive RVF epidemic in Egypt during 1977. Colour photography and fluorescein angiography of 7 serologically diagnosed patients showed the commonest manifestations to be macular, paramacular, and/or extramacular retinal lesions, often occurring bilaterally. Haemorrhage and oedema were frequently associated with the lesions, and vasculitis, retinitis, and vascular occlusion were also observed. Patients were monitored during a 6-month convalescence, and, though resorption of the lesions occurred, approximately half the patients experienced permanent loss of visual acuity. Ocular disease was one form of the clinical spectrum of RVF; acute febrile, encephalitic, and fatal haemorrhagic RVF illnesses were also observed during the epidemic."

"Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene","The demonstration of serological conversion to Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus in paired acute and convalescent sera established RVF as the cause of two cases of retinitis seen during the 1977 RVF epidemic in Egypt. Colour photography of the retina revealed macular, paramacular and extramacular exudate-like lesions with associated haemorrage and oedema. One patient has not recovered central vision during a six-month convalescence. An ongoing study of a larger group of RVF patients with ocular disease revealed that the findings presented for these two cases represented the types of lesions most frequently encountered during the epidemic."

"Journal of the South African Veterinary Association","In a study of the response in cattle to a live and an inactivated Rift Valley fever (RVF) vaccine prepared from cell cultures infected with RVF virus, the effects of varying doses and combinations of these vaccines were compared. The antibody response to a primary injection of either vaccines was poor when measured by the serum virus neutralization test (SVN) and the haemagglutination-inhibition test (HI) but a booster dose of inactivated vaccine evoked a good anamnestic response in cattle previously injected with either of these vaccines. Cattle vaccinated with the live vaccine but negative to the SVN or the HI for RVF were immune when challenged with a virulent RVF virus isolated from a cow during 1974."
"Tijdschrift voor diergeneeskunde","Rift Valley fever probably occurred in East and South Africa for many years, where it occasionally caused sever epizootics among sheep and to a less extent in cattle and goats. Particularly newborn animals fall victims to the disease, whereas the majority of pregnant ewes and cows abort. In recent years, the disease spread to the Sudan and reached the Nile delta in 1977, where it not only caused an epizootic but also an epidemic among the population, resulting in approximately 18,000 cases and nearly 600 deaths. During the summer of 1978, the disease was observed again so that the virus must have overwintered in the newly infested area. The disease in animals and subsequently in man, displaying four different clinical forms, is discussed. The limited knowledge of the pathogenesis and epidemiology is stressed particular attention being paid to the Egyptian epizootic and epidemic. Because of inadequate knowledge of the clinical features, pathogenesis and other data, the disease among cattle was not detected until from five to six months after it had broken out. The spread of Rift Valley fever to the north-eastern part of Africa forms a potential threat of dissemination of the virus to neighbouring countries, situated on the two adjacent continents of Asia and Europe, and it is a real one. International travel and movement of goods and animals as well as the political situation in that area involves the danger of the Rift Valley fever virus also being transferred to new areas and becoming established there."
"The Veterinary record","A disease causing increased mortality and abortion in domestic animals during a 1977 epizootic in Egypt was identified as Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus. The epizootic included extensive human involvement reflected clinically as either an acute febrile, ocular, encephalitic, or fatal haemorrhagic form of RVF disease. The virus was again isolated from humans and animals during a second RVF epizootic in the summer of 1978."
"British journal of experimental pathology","Laboratory mice were inoculated with 3 different strains of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV): namely, the prototype, the Nigerian, and the Lunyo variant strains of RVFV. Animals were inoculated with either infective mouse brain or serum by the i.c. or i.p. route and organs of inoculated animals examined for virus content and histopathological changes. Animals inoculated with either the classical or the Nigerian encephalitis only, to a ditropism involving mild lesions in the brain and liver or the typically severe RVFV hepatitis. The type of lesion shown was dependent on the source of inoculum and the route of inoculation. On the other hand, animals inoculated by the i.c. route with the infective brain material of the Lunyo variant virus showed a mild encephalitis, while the use of the i.p. route or infective blood source of the Lunyo virus resulted in the development of typical RVFV hepatitis. Typical intranuclear eosinophilic inclusion bodies were found in both the brain and liver of animals inoculated with the Lunyo variant virus. These inclusion bodies were found only in the livers of mice inoculated with the infective blood material of either the prototype or the Nigerian strain. There was no correlation between the virus titres in the different organs and the severity of histopathological lesions."
"Reviews of infectious diseases","In considering the diagnosis of a patient admitted to the Johannesburg Hospital, suffering from an illness characterized by high fever and complicated by a hemorrhagic state from which he died, a list of possible causes of his illness was drawn up. This list included the arthropodborne viral infections prevalent in southern Africa, namely, chikungunya fever, Sindbis fever, West Nile fever, yellow fever, and Rift Valley fever; viral infections associated with rodents, such as Lassa fever; the viral infection associated with monkeys, Marburg virus disease; the rickettsial infections; tick-bite fever (the variety of spotted fever of tick typhus occurring in southern Africa) and Q fever; the bacterial infections, especially the coccal infections, plague septicemia, and meningococcal, staphylococcal, and streptococcal septicemia; and the blood protozoal infections malaria and trypanosomiasis. In addition, rubella, Gasser's syndrome, Henoch-Schönlein purpura, and viperine snakebite were briefly described in this review. All of these conditions may be complicated by the development of a hemorrhagic state. The circulation of large numbers of infecting organisms, by they viruses, rickettsiae, bacteria, or protozoa, may initiate the coagulation cascade, the formation of fibrin and its deposition in the finer blood vessels, and the aggregation and entanglement of platelets resulting in marked thrombocytopenia and bleeding. This bleeding tendency is greatly aggravated when the infection specifically involves the parenchymal cells of the liver; such a condition results in defective formation of coagulation factors such as prothrombin. The proper care of patients in whom a hemorrhagic state has developed requires urgent and accurate diagnosis followed by immediate and appropriate treatment that will combat the infection and alleviate the hemorrhagic state and liver disorder. If the hemorrhagic state is due to one of the dangerous infectious fevers, adequate protection of the medical, nursing, and laboratory staff concerned is also vital."

"Research in veterinary science","Three strains of Rift Valley fever virus, namely Nigerian (NIG), Smithburn's neurotropic (SNT), and Lunyo variant (LUN) were compared by complement fixation (CF), neutralisation (N), haemagglutination/haemagglutination-inhibition (HA/HI) and agar gel diffusion (AGD) tests. They showed reciprocal cross-reactivity in CF tests. In N tests, using immune sheep sera, there was reciprocal cross-neutralisation between the NIG and SNT strains, but not with the LUN strain, the antiserum of which neutralised both NIG and SNT antigens whereas the reverse was not the case. When hyperimmune mouse ascitic fluid was employed in N tests, there was cross-reactivity between the three strains. Both the NIG and SNT strains yielded haemagglutinins, but not the LUN strain. Furthermore, by the antibody absorption and AGD techniques, the NIG and SNT strains were found to be identical and distinct from the LUN variant strain. The techniques found most useful in distinguishing between the three strains were HA and AGD. Laboratory neuro-adaptation of the classical pantropic virus did not appear to affect its haemagglutination activity."
"Research in veterinary science","West African dwarf sheep were inoculated with three different strains of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV). Using infective mouse serum as the source of virus classical RVFV disease characterised by sudden onset, a sharp but transient febrile response, viraemia, abortions and the development of specific RVFV antibodies in surviving animals was observed. The severity of clinical response was, however, dependent on the strain of virus used, with animals inoculated with Smithburn's neuroadapted strain showing a milder response than those inoculated with either the Nigerian or Lunyo strain. The inoculation of sheep with RVFV infective mouse brain material of the three different strains resulted in a mild febrile response with low level viraemia. Immune sera from sheep inoculated with both the Nigerian and Smithburn's neurotropic strains did not neutralise the Lunyo virus strain in a mouse intracerebral neutralisation test; the reverse, however, was not the case. The findings indicate that the West African dwarf sheep is highly susceptible to RVFV infection and that previous reports of only a mild clinical response following inoculation with the Nigerian strain were due to infective mouse brain rather than infective mouse serum."
"The Journal of general virology","Rift Valley fever virus isolates from the 1977 outbreak in Egypt were studied at an ultrastructural level. The particles measured 90 to 110 nm in diam. using negative staining and sectioning techniques, with a core component of 80 to 85 nm. The surface of the virions was calculated to be covered by approx. 160 sub-units. The particles were found in smooth endoplasmic reticular systems, which were made up of either multi-tubular complexes, or of a single large vacuole. The majority of these membrane systems were found to be unassociated with Golgi apparatus. Inclusion bodies were found within the host cell nuclei (made up of rods and fine granules) and in the cytoplasm (aggregates of fine or coarse granules). The possible relationship of these structures to virus replication is discussed."

The highest number of RVF virus isolates were obtained from sheep; only one isolate was recovered from each of the other species tested, viz. cow, camel, goat, horse, and rat. RVF virus was reisolated from both camel and horse sera, apparently for the first time."
"Bulletin of the World Health Organization","Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus was isolated from 53 of 56 sera collected from patients with a clinical picture of dengue-like illness during the peak of the epidemic of RVF in Egypt in the autumn of 1977. RVF virus was also isolated from the throat washings of two patients and the faeces of four, all of whom were positive for virus isolation from the serum. All the isolates were identified by the complement fixation (CF) test. Serological diagnosis of RVF, using paired sera from 16 patients, was made by both the haemagglutination-inhibition (HI) and CF tests. HI antibodies were demonstrated in all the acute sera, whereas CF antibodies, which seem to appear later, were detected in only seven acute and twelve convalescent sera. A longer period than the 12 days in this study must be allowed to elapse between the taking of the paired sera for a definite serological diagnosis to be obtained, especially when CF antibodies are taken into account."

"Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene","Epidemiological factors related to the introduction, spread and maintenance of Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus were studied during the 1977-78 epizootic in Egypt, Culex pipiens is the most ubiquitous and prevalent mosquito species in the Nile Valley and Delta. Isolation of RVF virus from unengorged C. pipiens, and demonstration of laboratory transmission of the virus by this species, strongly implicate it as the chief vector in Egypt. Virus transmission to man also occurs by contamination when handling infected meat and by inhaling natural virus aerosols. Wild rodents apparently do not serve as RVF virus reservoirs. Domestic sheep, cattle, buffaloes, camels, goats, donkeys and dogs act as amplifying hosts. Over 30% of the camels sampled at the southern border of Egypt were serologically positive for antibodies to RVF virus and it appears likely that the virus was introduced into Egypt, either by these animals or by other vehicles from the south."

In addition to immunization this ""decoy"" approach is therefore recommended to assist in the protection of stock from insect borne diseases such as bluetongue and possibly African horsesickness and Rift Valley fever."
"The Onderstepoort journal of veterinary research","This is a report on the clinical signs of Wesselsbron disease in 37 lambs and the pathology of 4 natural and 12 experimental cases. Generally the symptoms were ill-defined. At autopsy 13 of the 14 lambs revealed a mild to severe icterus and a slight to moderate hepatomegaly with discoloration of the liver. No foci of hepatic necrosis were observed macroscopically and, except for petechial and ecchymotic haemorrhages in the mucosa of the abomasum and generalized lymphadenopathy, no other obvious macroscopic lesions were noted. Perforation of the abomasum occurred in one lamb only. Microscopy on the liver showed mild to extensive necrosis of the parenchyma. Degenerated and necrotic hepatocytes were diffusely scattered throughout the liver, but no definite well-circumscribed foci of necrosis were seen. Mitotic figures and hepatocytes with large nuclei indicated that active regeneration of parenchymal cells had occurred in some of the livers. Other changes, for example, Kupffer cell proliferation, sinusoidal leucostasis, bile duct proliferation and infiltration of mononuclear cells in the portal triads, were frequently encountered. Moderate to severe cholestasis was a feature in 66% of the livers examined, while intranuclear inclusions and intracytoplasmic acidophilic or Councilman-like bodies were frequently observed. A complete haematological study was carried out on 4 experimentally produced cases. The gross and histopathological lesions in the liver are compared with those of Rift Valley fever in the new-born lamb."
"The Journal of hygiene","Brains, spleens and livers of 2214 murids, 27 shrews and 7 dormice, trapped at 7 sites in Rhodesia, were tested in 277 pools for the presence of Rift Valley Fever virus.

Sixteen out of 867 sera had low-titre haemagglutination-inhibition activity against Rift Valley Fever antigen, but only one out of 1260 sera had neutralizing antibody. The evidence suggests that murids fail to encounter infection in nature and are unlikely to play a role in circulation and dissemination of Rift Valley Fever virus. Four out of seven widely distributed species of muried, Rhabdomys pumilio, Saccostomys campestris, Aethomys chrysophilus and Lemniscomys griselda, were shown to be capable of circulating amounts of virus likely to be infective for mosquitoes."

This is a report on the gross pathology of 34 new-born lambs and the histopathology of 93 new-born lambs that died during this outbreak. The liver was affected in every case and showed the most pronounced lesions. The organ was grossly enlarged in most cases, with scattered greyish-white necrotic foci 1--2 mm in diameter and haemorrhages of varying size throughout. Haemorrhages were also frequently seen in the mucosa of the abomasum. The massive diffuse necrosis of hepatocytes (pannecrosis) associated with well-demarcated foci of primary coagulative necrosis, present in 100% of the cases examined, was characteristic of the histopathology of the new-born lamb. Bile thrombi were noticed in the livers of 31% of the lambs and intranuclear inclusions in 49% of the cases. The diagnostic significance of the microscopic liver lesions is discussed. Focal necrosis and haemorrhages were frequently seen in the adrenal cortex while generalized destruction of lymphocytes in the lymph nodes and spleen occurred in many of the animals. In addition, the following hitherto undescribed or previously not well-documented lesions are recorded: (i) mineralization of single or groups of necrotic hepatocytes in 62% of the livers: (ii) pyknosis and karyorrhexis of the cellular elements in the glomeruli and a hyalinized appearance of many of these affected glomeruli; and (iii) necrosis of the tips of the villi in the small intestine in some of the animals."

The ewes were vaccinated at different stages of gestation in spite of recommendations to the contrary, the syndrome being especially obvious in ewes immunized with one or both of these vaccines during the first trimester of pregnancy. In some of the flocks hydrops amnii was recorded in as many as 15% of the ewes. Many of the ewes so affected showed a prolonged gestation of up to 6-7 months and, towards the end of gestation, were unable to rise or walk. They eventually died of ketosis, hypostatic pneumonia and complications due to dystocia. The foetuses examined were malformed and larger than normal with a mass of 3,6-6,7 kg. They usually showed arthrogryposis, brachygnathy inferior, hydranencephaly, hypoplasia or segmental aplasia of the spinal cord and neurogenic muscular atrophy. The amnion contained 8,0-18,0 1 of amniotic fluid, the endometrium was oedematous, and cystic tube-like dilatations, 1-10 mm in diameter, filled with a clear fluid, were scattered in the endometrium. No definite conclusions as to the aetiology of the syndrome could be drawn from serological tests performed on the ewes, lambs or foetuses. Preliminary experimental work confirmed previous observations that the attenuated Wesselsbron disease vaccine virus is responsible for this syndrome and that the wild-type virus is also implicated. In addition, the attenuated Rift Valley fever vaccine virus was found to the responsible for arthrogryposis and hydranencephaly without hydrops amnii and for micrencephaly and arthrogryposis associated with hydrops amnii in the ewe."

"The Journal of hygiene","The epizootic range of Rift Valley fever in Kenya is defined from the results of virus isolations during epizootics, and form an extensive serological survey of cattle which were exposed during an epizootic. A study of the sera from a wide range of wild bovidae sampled immediately after the epizootic, showed that they did not act as reservoir or amplifying hosts for RVF. Virus isolation attempts from a variety of rodents proved negative. Rift Valley fever did not persist between epizootics by producing symptomless abortions in cattle in areas within its epizootic range. A sentinel herd sampled annually after an epizootic in 1968 revealed not one single seroconversion from 1969 to 1974. Certain forest and forest edge situations were postulated as enzootic for Rift Valley fever, and a small percentage of seroconversions were detected in cattle in these areas, born four years after the last epizootic. This has been the only evidence for the persistence of the virus in Kenya since 1968, and may be a part of the interepizootic maintenance cycle for Rift Valley fever in Kenya, which otherwise remains unknown."

"Applied microbiology","A model system is described for the mass propagation of Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus, utilizing large-volume fermentor units for suspension culture of tissue cells and the subsequent production of virus. Comparisons between laboratory- and fermentor-scale operations of tissue cell growth gave equivalent results. Cell viability dropped 24 to 30 hr postinfection with a subsequent virus yield between 10(8.0) and 10(9.0) mouse intracerebral median lethal doses per milliliter. Infecting volumes of tissue cell culture (20- or 40-liter working volumes) had no apparent effect on virus yields. Tissue cells grown under either oxidation-reduction potential- and pH-controlled or uncontrolled conditions showed little or no difference in their ability to produce RVF virus. We believe this tissue cell virus process to have potential application for large-scale production of vaccines for human or veterinary use or for the mass propagation of certain carcinogenic viruses for cancer research, once use of established lines for this purpose is accepted."

Ammonium sulfate, potassium sulfate, or alcohol was used as a precipitating agent and the precipitate was resuspended to volumes suitable for further processing and purification. The methods permitted concentration of live RVF virus and CHIK virus about 100-fold with negligible losses of virus. RVF virus retained a high level of infectivity with potassium aluminum sulfate and alcohol, but CHIK virus retained a higher infectivity level with ammonium sulfate than with potassium aluminum sulfate. The data indicate that serum plays an important role in the concentration of both viruses, at least when the sulfate methods are used."

Mild sonic treatment of the virus produced in serum-free medium increased the infective titer about 10x. This difference was not observed with virus produced in medium supplemented with serum. Peak titer was not affected by medium used during the infection period, by multiplicity of inoculum (MOI), or by initial cell concentration within the test range of 10(4) to 2 x 10(6) cell/ml. Cell strain employed influenced titer, because the L-DR cell did not produce virus efficiently at low MOI and low initial cell concentration. The time of peak titer and fold replication was dependent on MOI and initial cell concentration. Differences in virus propagation in monolayer and suspension systems are discussed."
"Applied microbiology","Studies were conducted on the interaction of various parameters which affect the storage stability and growth potential of liquid cultures of Pasteurella tularensis live vaccine strain (LVS) and Rift Valley fever virus Van Wyk strain (RVFV). Storage variables studied with LVS included four storage temperatures (4, -20, -65, -175 C), single and multiple freeze-thaw cycles, two freezing and two thawing rates (slow and fast), various inoculum levels (1, 3, 5, and 10%) for the determination of growth potential, and the retention of immunizing potential (mice and guinea pig) after storage. Neither the freezing rate nor the number of freeze-thaw cycles seriously affected the growth of LVS after storage at -175C; however, the slow rate of thaw proved deleterious as were all temperatures of storage except -175 C after 1 year of storage, as shown by both criteria of evaluation. RVFV produced in two combinations of cell lines and media (LM cell line-199 peptone medium and LDR cell line-Eagle's minimum essential medium) was stored at three serum levels (10, 20, 40%), three pH values (6.2., 7.0, 7.8), and three temperatures (-20, -65, -175 C). These studies indicated: (i) virus produced in the LDR cell line and Eagle's medium was more stable than that produced in the LM cell line and 199 peptone medium for either short- or long-term storage; (ii) serum levels did not affect stability; and (iii) low pH resulted in losses during long-term storage under all conditions tested. Thus, cryogenic storage is advantageous for stock culture maintenance of bacteria and viruses and for other similar applications."

"Applied microbiology","The effects of virus input multiplicity and of tissue cell concentration upon the growth of Rift Valley fever virus in L cells (Earle) were determined. The titers obtained in suspension cultures with cells obtained from two separate laboratories were significantly different. With both monolayer culture and suspension culture systems, a virus input multiplicity of 2.5 resulted in the greatest proliferation of virus. Optimal viral yields were obtained in suspension cultures containing 4 x 10(5) tissue cells per ml of suspension."

"British journal of pharmacology and chemotherapy","The blood and urine of mice and rats infected with Babesia rodhaini contain substances which stimulate the isolated guinea-pig ileum and rat duodenum. The amount of active material excreted increases as the infection increases. The active substances are stable to boiling with hydrochloric acid but not with alkali; they pass through a cellophane membrane and are soluble in hot ethanol. They are destroyed rapidly by papain and less rapidly by chymotrypsin, but are unaffected by trypsin or pepsin. Their action on smooth muscle is not affected by atropine, eserine, antihistamines, iproniazid, bretylium or by lysergic acid diethylamide. The active substances are probably peptides and there is evidence that the urine contains a mixture of peptides, some of which relax and some of which contract the rat duodenum. Similar active peptides appear in the urine of mice infected with Plasmodium berghei, Trypanosoma rhodesiense, Streptococcus pyogenes and Rift Valley fever virus."

"The Journal of experimental medicine","Three cases of Rift Valley fever in human individuals are reported. The virus was recovered from the respiratory tract of the patients and was transmitted to ferrets by the intranasal route. The experimental disease so produced in ferrets is characterized by fever, marked pulmonary lesions, and hemorrhagic phenomena. The results indicate that the virus of Rift Valley fever belongs to the group of filterable viruses which may gain entrance to the human body through the respiratory tract. The differential diagnosis of Rift Valley fever and influenza is discussed. While, clinically, this is a difficult problem, the diagnosis may be readily established through animal experimentation. Certain observations concerning the influence of the route of administration on the protective action of immune serum in serum-virus mixtures are presented."

"The Journal of experimental medicine","A case of Rift Valley fever following an accidental laboratory infection, and believed to be the first instance of the disease in the Western hemisphere, is reported. Although the course of illness was otherwise quite typical, it was complicated by thrombophlebitis-a condition not previously described in association with this disease in man. Death was caused by a pulmonary embolus."
